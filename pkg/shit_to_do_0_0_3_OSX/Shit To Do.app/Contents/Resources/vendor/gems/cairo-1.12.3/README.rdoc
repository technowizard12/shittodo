== Description

Ruby bindings for cairo // cairo extension for Ruby

http://cairographics.org/

== Dependencies

* ruby >= 1.8 (1.9.2 also supported!)
* cairo >= 1.2.0 (1.12.0 also supported!)

== Install

=== Package

This way is recommended.

  # gem install cairo

=== Self build

For experimental users.

Download rcairo-X.Y.Z.tar.gz from http://cairographics.org/releases/

Extracting:
  % tar xvzf rcairo-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

Compiling:
  % cd rcairo-X.Y.Z
  % ruby extconf.rb    # to check for dependencies and create Makefiles
  % make               # to compile

  # make install       # to install the cairo extension.
		       # The samples in the samples folder should be able
		       # to run before installation except text-on-path.rb
		       # and text2.rb. They uses Ruby/Pango with rcairo
		       # support. So you need to install rcairo and build
		       # Ruby/Pango with it before you run them.

Options to extconf.rb:

  * --without-vendor-override: Use system libraries instead of those found in
                               vendor/local for compiling
