Green Shoes
===========

Green Shoes is a Ruby domain specific language for beautiful Desktop Applications.
The Green Shoes dsl is so simple, even your pointy haired boss can understand it.
The Green Shoes project is based on _why-the-lucky-stiff's Shoes, except for the following:

* Green Shoes source code is all Ruby, so even you can contribute.
* Green Shoes takes the Ruby DSL block-style approach, so all you have to do is write what you know: Ruby.


Examples
========

Here is a quick example to get the juices flowing:

    require 'green_shoes'
	
    Shoes.app( :width => 250, :height => 250 ) do
      para 'Hello, world!'
      image 'images/shoes.png'
    end

There are a lot of samples [here in the sample box](https://github.com/ashbb/green_shoes/tree/master/samples).

2. [Gems](http://rubygems.org) 1.5 or above
3. [ruby-gtk2 package](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/) 0.90.7 or above
