.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned int * " status ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a gnutls session
.IP "unsigned int * status" 12
is the output of the verification
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will verify the peer's certificate and store
the status in the  \fIstatus\fP variable as a bitwise or'd gnutls_certificate_status_t
values or zero if the certificate is trusted. Note that value in  \fIstatus\fP is set only when the return value of this function is success (i.e, failure 
to trust a certificate does not imply a negative return value).

If available the OCSP Certificate Status extension will be
utilized by this function.

To avoid denial of service attacks some
default upper limits regarding the certificate key size and chain
size are set. To override them use \fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits()\fP.

Note that you must also check the peer's name in order to check if
the verified certificate belongs to the actual peer, see \fBgnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname()\fP,
or use \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers3()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
a negative error code on error and \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) on success.
