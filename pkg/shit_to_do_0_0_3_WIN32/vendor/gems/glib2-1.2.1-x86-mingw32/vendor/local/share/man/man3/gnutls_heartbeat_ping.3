.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_heartbeat_ping(gnutls_session_t " session ", size_t " data_size ", unsigned int " max_tries ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
is the length of the ping payload.
.IP "unsigned int max_tries" 12
if flags is \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP then this sets the number of retransmissions. Use zero for indefinite (until timeout).
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
if \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP then wait for pong or timeout instead of returning immediately.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends a ping to the peer. If the  \fIflags\fP is set
to \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP then it waits for a reply from the peer.

Note that it is highly recommended to use this function with the
flag \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP, or you need to handle retransmissions
and timeouts manually.
