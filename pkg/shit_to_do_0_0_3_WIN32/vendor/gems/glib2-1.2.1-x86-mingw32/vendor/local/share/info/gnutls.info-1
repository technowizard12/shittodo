1 Preface
*********

This document demonstrates and explains the GnuTLS library API.  A
brief introduction to the protocols and the technology involved is also
included so that an application programmer can better understand the
GnuTLS purpose and actual offerings.  Even if GnuTLS is a typical
library software, it operates over several security and cryptographic
protocols which require the programmer to make careful and correct
usage of them. Otherwise it is likely to only obtain a false sense of
security.  The term of security is very broad even if restricted to
computer software, and cannot be confined to a single cryptographic
library.  For that reason, do not consider any program secure just
because it uses GnuTLS; there are several ways to compromise a program
or a communication line and GnuTLS only helps with some of them.

Although this document tries to be self contained, basic network
programming and public key infrastructure (PKI) knowledge is assumed in
most of it. A good introduction to networking can be found in
[_STEVENS_], to public key infrastructure in [_GUTPKI_] and to security
engineering in [_ANDERSON_].

Updated versions of the GnuTLS software and this document will be
available from `http://www.gnutls.org/' and
`http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/'.

2 Introduction to GnuTLS
************************

In brief GnuTLS can be described as a library which offers an API to
access secure communication protocols. These protocols provide privacy
over insecure lines, and were designed to prevent eavesdropping,
tampering, or message forgery.

Technically GnuTLS is a portable ANSI C based library which implements
the protocols ranging from SSL 3.0 to TLS 1.2 (see *note Introduction
to TLS::, for a detailed description of the protocols), accompanied
with the required framework for authentication and public key
infrastructure.  Important features of the GnuTLS library include:

   * Support for TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 protocols.

   * Support for Datagram TLS 1.0.

   * Support for handling and verification of X.509 and OpenPGP
     certificates.

   * Support for password authentication using TLS-SRP.

   * Support for keyed authentication using TLS-PSK.

   * Support for TPM, PKCS #11 tokens and smart-cards.


The GnuTLS library consists of three independent parts, namely the "TLS
protocol part", the "Certificate part", and the "Cryptographic
back-end" part.  The "TLS protocol part" is the actual protocol
implementation, and is entirely implemented within the GnuTLS library.
The "Certificate part" consists of the certificate parsing, and
verification functions and it uses functionality from the libtasn1(1)
library.  The "Cryptographic back-end" is provided by the nettle(2)
library.

2.1 Downloading and installing
==============================

GnuTLS is available for download at:
`http://www.gnutls.org/download.html'

GnuTLS uses a development cycle where even minor version numbers
indicate a stable release and a odd minor version number indicate a
development release.  For example, GnuTLS 1.6.3 denote a stable release
since 6 is even, and GnuTLS 1.7.11 denote a development release since 7
is odd.

GnuTLS depends on Libnettle, and you will need to install it before
installing GnuTLS.  Libnettle is available from
`http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/'.  Don't forget to verify the
cryptographic signature after downloading source code packages.

The package is then extracted, configured and built like many other
packages that use Autoconf.  For detailed information on configuring
and building it, refer to the `INSTALL' file that is part of the
distribution archive.  Typically you invoke `./configure' and then
`make check install'.  There are a number of compile-time parameters,
as discussed below.

The compression library, libz, as well as p11-kit are a optional
dependencies.  You can get libz from `http://www.zlib.net/' and p11-kit
from `http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/'.

The X.509 part of GnuTLS needs ASN.1 functionality, from a library
called libtasn1.  A copy of libtasn1 is included in GnuTLS.  If you
want to install it separately (e.g., to make it possibly to use
libtasn1 in other programs), you can get it from
`http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/download.html'.

A few `configure' options may be relevant, summarized below.  They
disable or enable particular features, to create a smaller library with
only the required features.  Note however, that although a smaller
library is generated, the included programs are not guarranteed to
compile if some of these options are given.

--disable-srp-authentication
--disable-psk-authentication
--disable-anon-authentication
--disable-extra-pki
--disable-openpgp-authentication
--disable-openssl-compatibility
--disable-libdane
--without-p11-kit
--without-tpm
--disable-dtls-srtp-support

For the complete list, refer to the output from `configure --help'.

3 Introduction to TLS and DTLS
******************************

TLS stands for "Transport Layer Security" and is the successor of SSL,
the Secure Sockets Layer protocol [_SSL3_] designed by Netscape.  TLS
is an Internet protocol, defined by IETF(1), described in [_RFC5246_].
The protocol provides confidentiality, and authentication layers over
any reliable transport layer.  The description, above, refers to TLS
1.0 but applies to all other TLS versions as the differences between
the protocols are not major.

The DTLS protocol, or "Datagram TLS" [_RFC4347_] is a protocol with
identical goals as TLS, but can operate under unreliable transport
layers such as UDP. The discussions below apply to this protocol as
well, except when noted otherwise.

3.1 TLS layers
==============

TLS is a layered protocol, and consists of the record protocol, the
handshake protocol and the alert protocol. The record protocol is to
serve all other protocols and is above the transport layer.  The record
protocol offers symmetric encryption, data authenticity, and optionally
compression.  The alert protocol offers some signaling to the other
protocols. It can help informing the peer for the cause of failures and
other error conditions.  *Note The Alert Protocol::, for more
information.  The alert protocol is above the record protocol.

The handshake protocol is responsible for the security parameters'
negotiation, the initial key exchange and authentication.  *Note The
Handshake Protocol::, for more information about the handshake
protocol.  The protocol layering in TLS is shown in *note
fig:tls-layers::.

3.2 The transport layer
=======================

TLS is not limited to any transport layer and can be used above any
transport layer, as long as it is a reliable one.  DTLS can be used
over reliable and unreliable transport layers.  GnuTLS supports TCP and
UDP layers transparently using the Berkeley sockets API. However, any
transport layer can be used by providing callbacks for GnuTLS to access
the transport layer (for details see *note Setting up the transport
layer::).


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS record protocol,  Next: The TLS Alert Protocol,  Prev: The transport layer,  Up: Introduction to TLS

3.3 The TLS record protocol
===========================

The record protocol is the secure communications provider. Its purpose
is to encrypt, authenticate and --optionally-- compress packets.  The
record layer functions can be called at any time after the handshake
process is finished, when there is need to receive or send data. In
DTLS however, due to re-transmission timers used in the handshake
out-of-order handshake data might be received for some time (maximum 60
seconds) after the handshake process is finished.

The functions to access the record protocol are limited to send and
receive functions, which might, given the importance of this protocol
in TLS, seem awkward.  This is because the record protocol's parameters
are all set by the handshake protocol.  The record protocol initially
starts with NULL parameters, which means no encryption, and no MAC is
used. Encryption and authentication begin just after the handshake
protocol has finished.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Encryption algorithms used in the record layer,  Next: Compression algorithms used in the record layer,  Up: The TLS record protocol

3.3.1 Encryption algorithms used in the record layer
----------------------------------------------------

Confidentiality in the record layer is achieved by using symmetric
block encryption algorithms like `3DES', `AES' or stream algorithms
like `ARCFOUR_128'.   Ciphers are encryption algorithms that use a
single, secret, key to encrypt and decrypt data. Block algorithms in
CBC mode also provide protection against statistical analysis of the
data.  Thus, if you're using the TLS protocol, a random number of
blocks will be appended to data, to prevent eavesdroppers from guessing
the actual data size.

The supported in GnuTLS ciphers and MAC algorithms are shown in *note
tab:ciphers:: and *note tab:macs::.

Algorithm      Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
3DES_CBC        This is the DES block cipher algorithm used with
               triple encryption (EDE). Has 64 bits block size
               and is used in CBC mode.
ARCFOUR_128     ARCFOUR_128 is a compatible algorithm with RSA's
               RC4 algorithm, which is considered to be a trade
               secret. It is a fast cipher but considered weak
               today.
ARCFOUR_40      This is the ARCFOUR cipher fed with a 40 bit key,
               which is considered weak.
AES_CBC         AES or RIJNDAEL is the block cipher algorithm
               that replaces the old DES algorithm.  Has 128
               bits block size and is used in CBC mode.
AES_GCM         This is the AES algorithm in the authenticated
               encryption GCM mode.  This mode combines message
               authentication and encryption and can be
               extremely fast on CPUs that support hardware
               acceleration.
CAMELLIA_CBC    This is an 128-bit block cipher developed by
               Mitsubishi and NTT. It is one of the approved
               ciphers of the European NESSIE and Japanese
               CRYPTREC projects.

Table 3.1: Supported ciphers.

Algorithm      Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
MAC_MD5         This is an HMAC based on MD5 a cryptographic
               hash algorithm designed by Ron Rivest. Outputs
               128 bits of data.
MAC_SHA1        An HMAC based on the SHA1 cryptographic hash
               algorithm designed by NSA. Outputs 160 bits of
               data.
MAC_SHA256      An HMAC based on SHA256. Outputs 256 bits of
               data.
MAC_AEAD        This indicates that an authenticated encryption
               algorithm, such as GCM, is in use.

3.3.2 Compression algorithms used in the record layer
-----------------------------------------------------

The TLS record layer also supports compression.  The algorithms
implemented in GnuTLS can be found in the table below.  The included
algorithms perform really good when text, or other compressible data
are to be transferred, but offer nothing on already compressed data,
such as compressed images, zipped archives etc.  These compression
algorithms, may be useful in high bandwidth TLS tunnels, and in cases
where network usage has to be minimized. It should be noted however
that compression increases latency.

The record layer compression in GnuTLS is implemented based on
[_RFC3749_]. The supported algorithms are shown below.

`GNUTLS_COMP_UNKNOWN'
     Unknown compression method.

`GNUTLS_COMP_NULL'
     The NULL compression method (no compression).

`GNUTLS_COMP_DEFLATE'
     The DEFLATE compression method from zlib.

`GNUTLS_COMP_ZLIB'
     Same as `GNUTLS_COMP_DEFLATE' .

Figure 3.2: Supported compression algorithms

Note that compression enables attacks such as traffic analysis, or even
plaintext recovery under certain circumstances. To avoid some of these
attacks GnuTLS allows each record to be compressed independently (i.e.,
stateless compression), by using the "%STATELESS_COMPRESSION" priority
string, in order to be used in cases where the attacker controlled data
are pt in separate records.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Weaknesses and countermeasures,  Next: On Record Padding,  Prev: Compression algorithms used in the record layer,  Up: The TLS record protocol

3.3.3 Weaknesses and countermeasures
------------------------------------

Some weaknesses that may affect the security of the record layer have
been found in TLS 1.0 protocol. These weaknesses can be exploited by
active attackers, and exploit the facts that

  1. TLS has separate alerts for "decryption_failed" and
     "bad_record_mac"

  2. The decryption failure reason can be detected by timing the
     response time.

  3. The IV for CBC encrypted packets is the last block of the previous
     encrypted packet.


Those weaknesses were solved in TLS 1.1 [_RFC4346_] which is
implemented in GnuTLS. For this reason we suggest to always negotiate
the highest supported TLS version with the peer(1).  For a detailed
discussion of the issues see the archives of the TLS Working Group
mailing list and [_CBCATT_].

Interoperability::.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: On Record Padding,  Prev: Weaknesses and countermeasures,  Up: The TLS record protocol

3.3.4 On record padding
-----------------------

The TLS protocol allows for random padding of records in CBC ciphers,
to prevent statistical analysis based on the length of exchanged
messages (see [_RFC5246_] section 6.2.3.2).  GnuTLS appears to be one
of few implementation that take advantage of this text, and pad records
by a random length.

The TLS implementation in the Symbian operating system, frequently used
by Nokia and Sony-Ericsson mobile phones, cannot handle non-minimal
record padding.  What happens when one of these clients handshake with
a GnuTLS server is that the client will fail to compute the correct MAC
for the record.  The client sends a TLS alert (`bad_record_mac') and
disconnects.  Typically this will result in error messages such as 'A
TLS fatal alert has been received', 'Bad record MAC', or both, on the
GnuTLS server side.

GnuTLS implements a work around for this problem.  However, it has to
be enabled specifically.  It can be enabled by using *note
gnutls_record_disable_padding::, or *note gnutls_priority_set:: with
the `%COMPAT' priority string (see *note Priority Strings::).

If you implement an application that have a configuration file, we
recommend that you make it possible for users or administrators to
specify a GnuTLS protocol priority string, which is used by your
application via *note gnutls_priority_set::.  To allow the best
flexibility, make it possible to have a different priority string for
different incoming IP addresses.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS Alert Protocol,  Next: The TLS Handshake Protocol,  Prev: The TLS record protocol,  Up: Introduction to TLS

3.4 The TLS alert protocol
==========================

The alert protocol is there to allow signals to be sent between peers.
These signals are mostly used to inform the peer about the cause of a
protocol failure. Some of these signals are used internally by the
protocol and the application protocol does not have to cope with them
(e.g. `GNUTLS_A_CLOSE_NOTIFY'), and others refer to the application
protocol solely (e.g. `GNUTLS_A_USER_CANCELLED').  An alert signal
includes a level indication which may be either fatal or warning. Fatal
alerts always terminate the current connection, and prevent future
re-negotiations using the current session ID. All alert messages are
summarized in the table below.

The alert messages are protected by the record protocol, thus the
information that is included does not leak. You must take extreme care
for the alert information not to leak to a possible attacker, via
public log files etc.

Alert                                    ID      Description

3.5 The TLS handshake protocol
==============================

The handshake protocol is responsible for the ciphersuite negotiation,
the initial key exchange, and the authentication of the two peers.
This is fully controlled by the application layer, thus your program
has to set up the required parameters. The main handshake function is
*note gnutls_handshake::. In the next paragraphs we elaborate on the
handshake protocol, i.e., the ciphersuite negotiation.

* Menu:

* TLS Cipher Suites::           TLS session parameters.
* Authentication::              TLS authentication.
* Client Authentication::       Requesting a certificate from the client.
* Resuming Sessions::           Reusing previously established keys.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Cipher Suites,  Next: Authentication,  Up: The TLS Handshake Protocol

3.5.1 TLS ciphersuites
----------------------

The handshake protocol of TLS negotiates cipher suites of a special
form illustrated by the `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_CBC_SHA' cipher suite
name.  A typical cipher suite contains these parameters:

   * The key exchange algorithm.  `DHE_RSA' in the example.

   * The Symmetric encryption algorithm and mode `3DES_CBC' in this
     example.

   * The MAC(1) algorithm used for authentication.  `MAC_SHA' is used
     in the above example.


The cipher suite negotiated in the handshake protocol will affect the
record protocol, by enabling encryption and data authentication.  Note
that you should not over rely on TLS to negotiate the strongest
available cipher suite. Do not enable ciphers and algorithms that you
consider weak.

All the supported ciphersuites are listed in *note ciphersuites::.

3.5.2 Authentication
--------------------

The key exchange algorithms of the TLS protocol offer authentication,
which is a prerequisite for a secure connection.  The available
authentication methods in GnuTLS follow.

   * Certificate authentication: Authenticated key exchange using
     public key infrastructure and certificates (X.509 or OpenPGP).

   * SRP authentication: Authenticated key exchange using a password.

   * PSK authentication: Authenticated key exchange using a pre-shared
     key.

   * Anonymous authentication: Key exchange without peer authentication.

3.5.3 Client authentication
---------------------------

In the case of ciphersuites that use certificate authentication, the
authentication of the client is optional in TLS.  A server may request
a certificate from the client using the *note
gnutls_certificate_server_set_request:: function. We elaborate in *note
Certificate credentials::.

3.5.4 Resuming sessions
-----------------------

The TLS handshake process performs expensive calculations and a busy
server might easily be put under load. To reduce the load, session
resumption may be used. This is a feature of the TLS protocol which
allows a client to connect to a server after a successful handshake,
without the expensive calculations.  This is achieved by re-using the
previously established keys, meaning the server needs to store the
state of established connections (unless session tickets are used -
*note Session tickets::).

Session resumption is an integral part of GnuTLS, and *note Session
resumption::, *note ex:resume-client:: illustrate typical uses of it.

3.6 TLS extensions
==================

A number of extensions to the TLS protocol have been proposed mainly in
[_TLSEXT_]. The extensions supported in GnuTLS are:

   * Maximum fragment length negotiation

   * Server name indication

   * Session tickets

   * HeartBeat

   * Safe Renegotiation

and they will be discussed in the subsections that follow.

* Menu:

* Maximum fragment length negotiation::
* Server name indication::
* Session tickets::
* HeartBeat::
* Safe renegotiation::
* OCSP status request::
* SRTP::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Maximum fragment length negotiation,  Next: Server name indication,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.1 Maximum fragment length negotiation
-----------------------------------------

This extension allows a TLS implementation to negotiate a smaller value
for record packet maximum length. This extension may be useful to
clients with constrained capabilities. The functions shown below can be
used to control this extension.

`SIZE_T *note gnutls_record_get_max_size:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'

`SSIZE_T *note gnutls_record_set_max_size:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t SIZE)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Server name indication,  Next: Session tickets,  Prev: Maximum fragment length negotiation,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.2 Server name indication
----------------------------

A common problem in HTTPS servers is the fact that the TLS protocol is
not aware of the hostname that a client connects to, when the handshake
procedure begins. For that reason the TLS server has no way to know
which certificate to send.

This extension solves that problem within the TLS protocol, and allows
a client to send the HTTP hostname before the handshake begins within
the first handshake packet.  The functions *note
gnutls_server_name_set:: and *note gnutls_server_name_get:: can be used
to enable this extension, or to retrieve the name sent by a client.

`INT *note gnutls_server_name_set:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_server_name_type_t TYPE, const void * NAME, size_t NAME_LENGTH)'

`INT *note gnutls_server_name_get:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, void * DATA, size_t * DATA_LENGTH, unsigned int * TYPE, unsigned int INDX)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Session tickets,  Next: HeartBeat,  Prev: Server name indication,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.3 Session tickets
---------------------

To resume a TLS session the server normally store session parameters.
This complicates deployment, and could be avoiding by delegating the
storage to the client. Because session parameters are sensitive they
are encrypted and authenticated with a key only known to the server and
then sent to the client. The Session Tickets extension is described in
RFC 5077 [_TLSTKT_].

Since version 3.1.3 GnuTLS clients transparently support session
tickets.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: HeartBeat,  Next: Safe renegotiation,  Prev: Session tickets,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.4 HeartBeat
---------------

This TLS extension allows to ping and receive confirmation from the
peer, is described in [_RFC6520_]. The extension is disabled by default
and *note gnutls_heartbeat_enable:: can be used to enable it. A policy
may be negotiated to only allow sending heartbeat messages or sending
and receiving.  The current session policy can be checked with *note
gnutls_heartbeat_allowed::.  The requests coming from the peer result
to `GNUTLS_E_HERTBEAT_PING_RECEIVED' being returned from the receive
function. Ping requests to peer can be send via *note
gnutls_heartbeat_ping::.

`INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_allowed:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int TYPE)'

`VOID *note gnutls_heartbeat_enable:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_ping:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t DATA_SIZE, unsigned int MAX_TRIES, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_pong:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`VOID *note gnutls_heartbeat_set_timeouts:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int RETRANS_TIMEOUT, unsigned int TOTAL_TIMEOUT)'

`UNSIGNED INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_get_timeout:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Safe renegotiation,  Next: OCSP status request,  Prev: HeartBeat,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.5 Safe renegotiation
------------------------

TLS gives the option to two communicating parties to renegotiate and
update their security parameters. One useful example of this feature
was for a client to initially connect using anonymous negotiation to a
server, and the renegotiate using some authenticated ciphersuite. This
occurred to avoid having the client sending its credentials in the
clear.

However this renegotiation, as initially designed would not ensure that
the party one is renegotiating is the same as the one in the initial
negotiation.  For example one server could forward all renegotiation
traffic to an other server who will see this traffic as an initial
negotiation attempt.

This might be seen as a valid design decision, but it seems it was not
widely known or understood, thus today some application protocols the
TLS renegotiation feature in a manner that enables a malicious server
to insert content of his choice in the beginning of a TLS session.

The most prominent vulnerability was with HTTPS. There servers request
a renegotiation to enforce an anonymous user to use a certificate in
order to access certain parts of a web site.  The attack works by
having the attacker simulate a client and connect to a server, with
server-only authentication, and send some data intended to cause harm.
The server will then require renegotiation from him in order to perform
the request.  When the proper client attempts to contact the server,
the attacker hijacks that connection and forwards traffic to the
initial server that requested renegotiation.  The attacker will not be
able to read the data exchanged between the client and the server.
However, the server will (incorrectly) assume that the initial request
sent by the attacker was sent by the now authenticated client.  The
result is a prefix plain-text injection attack.

The above is just one example.  Other vulnerabilities exists that do
not rely on the TLS renegotiation to change the client's authenticated
status (either TLS or application layer).

While fixing these application protocols and implementations would be
one natural reaction, an extension to TLS has been designed that
cryptographically binds together any renegotiated handshakes with the
initial negotiation.  When the extension is used, the attack is
detected and the session can be terminated.  The extension is specified
in [_RFC5746_].

GnuTLS supports the safe renegotiation extension.  The default behavior
is as follows.  Clients will attempt to negotiate the safe
renegotiation extension when talking to servers.  Servers will accept
the extension when presented by clients.  Clients and servers will
permit an initial handshake to complete even when the other side does
not support the safe renegotiation extension.  Clients and servers will
refuse renegotiation attempts when the extension has not been
negotiated.

Note that permitting clients to connect to servers when the safe
renegotiation extension is not enabled, is open up for attacks.
Changing this default behavior would prevent interoperability against
the majority of deployed servers out there.  We will reconsider this
default behavior in the future when more servers have been upgraded.
Note that it is easy to configure clients to always require the safe
renegotiation extension from servers.

To modify the default behavior, we have introduced some new priority
strings (see *note Priority Strings::).  The `%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION'
priority string permits (re-)handshakes even when the safe
renegotiation extension was not negotiated. The default behavior is
`%PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION' that will prevent renegotiation with clients
and servers not supporting the extension. This is secure for servers
but leaves clients vulnerable to some attacks, but this is a trade-off
between security and compatibility with old servers. The
`%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION' priority string makes clients and servers require
the extension for every handshake. The latter is the most secure option
for clients, at the cost of not being able to connect to legacy
servers. Servers will also deny clients that do not support the
extension from connecting.

It is possible to disable use of the extension completely, in both
clients and servers, by using the `%DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION'
priority string however we strongly recommend you to only do this for
debugging and test purposes.

The default values if the flags above are not specified are:
`Server:'
     %PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION

`Client:'
     %PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION


For applications we have introduced a new API related to safe
renegotiation.  The *note gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status:: function is
used to check if the extension has been negotiated on a session, and
can be used both by clients and servers.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: OCSP status request,  Next: SRTP,  Prev: Safe renegotiation,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.6 OCSP status request
-------------------------

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a protocol that allows
the client to verify the server certificate for revocation without
messing with certificate revocation lists. Its drawback is that it
requires the client to connect to the server's CA OCSP server and
request the status of the certificate. This extension however, enables
a TLS server to include its CA OCSP server response in the handshake.
That is an HTTPS server may periodically run `ocsptool' (see *note
ocsptool Invocation::) to obtain its certificate revocation status and
serve it to the clients. That way a client avoids an additional
connection to the OCSP server.

`VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_function:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC, gnutls_status_request_ocsp_func OCSP_FUNC, void * PTR)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC, const char* RESPONSE_FILE, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_status_request_enable_client:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t * RESPONDER_ID, size_t RESPONDER_ID_SIZE, gnutls_datum_t * EXTENSIONS)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_status_request_is_checked:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int FLAGS)'

A server is required to provide the OCSP server's response using the
*note gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file::.  The response
may be obtained periodically using the following command.

     ocsptool --ask --load-cert server_cert.pem --load-issuer the_issuer.pem
              --load-signer the_issuer.pem --outfile ocsp.response

Since version 3.1.3 GnuTLS clients transparently support the
certificate status request.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: SRTP,  Prev: OCSP status request,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.7 SRTP
----------

The TLS protocol was extended in [_RFC5764_] to provide keying material
to the Secure RTP (SRTP) protocol. The SRTP protocol provides an
encapsulation of encrypted data that is optimized for voice data. With
the SRTP TLS extension two peers can negotiate keys using TLS or DTLS
and obtain keying material for use with SRTP. The available SRTP
profiles are listed below.

`GNUTLS_SRTP_AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_80'
     128 bit AES with a 80 bit HMAC-SHA1

`GNUTLS_SRTP_AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_32'
     128 bit AES with a 32 bit HMAC-SHA1

`GNUTLS_SRTP_NULL_HMAC_SHA1_80'
     NULL cipher with a 80 bit HMAC-SHA1

`GNUTLS_SRTP_NULL_HMAC_SHA1_32'
     NULL cipher with a 32 bit HMAC-SHA1

Figure 3.3: Supported SRTP profiles

To enable use the following functions.

`INT *note gnutls_srtp_set_profile:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_srtp_profile_t PROFILE)'

`INT *note gnutls_srtp_set_profile_direct:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * PROFILES, const char ** ERR_POS)'

To obtain the negotiated keys use the function below.

 -- Function: int gnutls_srtp_get_keys (gnutls_session_t SESSION, void
          * KEY_MATERIAL, unsigned int KEY_MATERIAL_SIZE,
          gnutls_datum_t * CLIENT_KEY, gnutls_datum_t * CLIENT_SALT,
          gnutls_datum_t * SERVER_KEY, gnutls_datum_t * SERVER_SALT)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     KEY_MATERIAL: Space to hold the generated key material

     KEY_MATERIAL_SIZE: The maximum size of the key material

     CLIENT_KEY: The master client write key, pointing inside the key
     material

     CLIENT_SALT: The master client write salt, pointing inside the key
     material

     SERVER_KEY: The master server write key, pointing inside the key
     material

     SERVER_SALT: The master server write salt, pointing inside the key
     material

     This is a helper function to generate the keying material for SRTP.
     It requires the space of the key material to be pre-allocated
     (should be at least 2x the maximum key size and salt size). The
     `client_key' ,  `client_salt' ,  `server_key' and  `server_salt'
     are convenience datums that point inside the key material. They may
     be `NULL' .

     *Returns:* On success the size of the key material is returned,
     otherwise, `GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER'  if the buffer given is
     not sufficient, or a negative error code.

     Since 3.1.4

Other helper functions are listed below.

`INT *note gnutls_srtp_get_selected_profile:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_srtp_profile_t * PROFILE)'

`CONST CHAR * *note gnutls_srtp_get_profile_name:: (gnutls_srtp_profile_t PROFILE)'

3.7 How to use TLS in application protocols
===========================================

This chapter is intended to provide some hints on how to use the TLS
over simple custom made application protocols.  The discussion below
mainly refers to the TCP/IP transport layer but may be extended to
other ones too.

* Menu:

* Separate ports::
* Upward negotiation::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Separate ports,  Next: Upward negotiation,  Up: How to use TLS in application protocols

3.7.1 Separate ports
--------------------

Traditionally SSL was used in application protocols by assigning a new
port number for the secure services. That way two separate ports were
assigned, one for the non secure sessions, and one for the secured
ones. This has the benefit that if a user requests a secure session
then the client will try to connect to the secure port and fail
otherwise. The only possible attack with this method is a denial of
service one. The most famous example of this method is the famous "HTTP
over TLS" or HTTPS protocol [_RFC2818_].

Despite its wide use, this method is not as good as it seems.  This
approach starts the TLS Handshake procedure just after the client
connects on the --so called-- secure port.  That way the TLS protocol
does not know anything about the client, and popular methods like the
host advertising in HTTP do not work(1).  There is no way for the
client to say "I connected to YYY server" before the Handshake starts,
so the server cannot possibly know which certificate to use.

Other than that it requires two separate ports to run a single service,
which is unnecessary complication. Due to the fact that there is a
limitation on the available privileged ports, this approach was soon
obsoleted.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Upward negotiation,  Prev: Separate ports,  Up: How to use TLS in application protocols

3.7.2 Upward negotiation
------------------------

Other application protocols(1)  use a different approach to enable the
secure layer.  They use something often called as the "TLS upgrade"
method. This method is quite tricky but it is more flexible. The idea
is to extend the application protocol to have a "STARTTLS" request,
whose purpose it to start the TLS protocols just after the client
requests it.  This approach does not require any extra port to be
reserved.  There is even an extension to HTTP protocol to support that
method [_RFC2817_].

The tricky part, in this method, is that the "STARTTLS" request is sent
in the clear, thus is vulnerable to modifications.  A typical attack is
to modify the messages in a way that the client is fooled and thinks
that the server does not have the "STARTTLS" capability.  See a typical
conversation of a hypothetical protocol:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     SERVER: OK

     *** TLS STARTS

     CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA

And see an example of a conversation where someone is acting in between:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     (here someone inserts this message)

     SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

     CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA

As you can see above the client was fooled, and was dummy enough to
send the confidential data in the clear.

How to avoid the above attack? As you may have already noticed this one
is easy to avoid. The client has to ask the user before it connects
whether the user requests TLS or not. If the user answered that he
certainly wants the secure layer the last conversation should be:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     (here someone inserts this message)

     SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

     CLIENT: BYE

     (the client notifies the user that the secure connection was not
     possible)

This method, if implemented properly, is far better than the
traditional method, and the security properties remain the same, since
only denial of service is possible. The benefit is that the server may
request additional data before the TLS Handshake protocol starts, in
order to send the correct certificate, use the correct password file,
or anything else!

3.8 On SSL 2 and older protocols
================================

One of the initial decisions in the GnuTLS development was to implement
the known security protocols for the transport layer.  Initially TLS
1.0 was implemented since it was the latest at that time, and was
considered to be the most advanced in security properties.  Later the
SSL 3.0 protocol was implemented since it is still the only protocol
supported by several servers and there are no serious security
vulnerabilities known.

One question that may arise is why we didn't implement SSL 2.0 in the
library.  There are several reasons, most important being that it has
serious security flaws, unacceptable for a modern security library.
Other than that, this protocol is barely used by anyone these days
since it has been deprecated since 1996.  The security problems in SSL
2.0 include:

   * Message integrity compromised.  The SSLv2 message authentication
     uses the MD5 function, and is insecure.

   * Man-in-the-middle attack.  There is no protection of the handshake
     in SSLv2, which permits a man-in-the-middle attack.

   * Truncation attack.  SSLv2 relies on TCP FIN to close the session,
     so the attacker can forge a TCP FIN, and the peer cannot tell if
     it was a legitimate end of data or not.

   * Weak message integrity for export ciphers.  The cryptographic keys
     in SSLv2 are used for both message authentication and encryption,
     so if weak encryption schemes are negotiated (say 40-bit keys) the
     message authentication code uses the same weak key, which isn't
     necessary.


Other protocols such as Microsoft's PCT 1 and PCT 2 were not
implemented because they were also abandoned and deprecated by SSL 3.0
and later TLS 1.0.

4 Certificate authentication
****************************

The most known authentication method of TLS are certificates.  The PKIX
[_PKIX_] public key infrastructure is daily used by anyone using a
browser today. GnuTLS supports both X.509 certificates [_PKIX_] and
OpenPGP certificates using a common API.

The key exchange algorithms supported by certificate authentication are
shown in *note tab:key-exchange::.

Key exchange   Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
RSA             The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and
               send it to the peer.  The certificate must allow
               the key to be used for encryption.
RSA_EXPORT      The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and
               send it to the peer.  In the EXPORT algorithm,
               the server signs temporary RSA parameters of 512
               bits -- which are considered weak -- and sends
               them to the client.
DHE_RSA         The RSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters which are sent to the
               peer. The key in the certificate must allow the
               key to be used for signing. Note that key
               exchange algorithms which use ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters, offer perfect forward
               secrecy. That means that even if the private key
               used for signing is compromised, it cannot be
               used to reveal past session data.
ECDHE_RSA       The RSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman parameters which
               are sent to the peer. The key in the certificate
               must allow the key to be used for signing. It
               also offers perfect forward secrecy. That means
               that even if the private key used for signing is
               compromised, it cannot be used to reveal past
               session data.
DHE_DSS         The DSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters which are sent to the
               peer. The certificate must contain DSA parameters
               to use this key exchange algorithm. DSA is the
               algorithm of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS).
ECDHE_ECDSA     The Elliptic curve DSA algorithm is used to sign
               ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
               parameters which are sent to the peer. The
               certificate must contain ECDSA parameters (i.e.,
               EC and marked for signing) to use this key
               exchange algorithm.

4.1 X.509 certificates
======================

The X.509 protocols rely on a hierarchical trust model. In this trust
model Certification Authorities (CAs) are used to certify entities.
Usually more than one certification authorities exist, and
certification authorities may certify other authorities to issue
certificates as well, following a hierarchical model.

 [image src="gnutls-x509.png" ]

Figure 4.1: An example of the X.509 hierarchical trust model.

One needs to trust one or more CAs for his secure communications. In
that case only the certificates issued by the trusted authorities are
acceptable.  The framework is illustrated on *note Figure 4.1: fig:x509.

4.1.1 X.509 certificate structure
---------------------------------

An X.509 certificate usually contains information about the certificate
holder, the signer, a unique serial number, expiration dates and some
other fields [_PKIX_] as shown in *note tab:x509::.

Field          Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
version         The field that indicates the version of the
               certificate.
serialNumber    This field holds a unique serial number per
               certificate.
signature       The issuing authority's signature.
issuer          Holds the issuer's distinguished name.
validity        The activation and expiration dates.
subject         The subject's distinguished name of the
               certificate.
extensions      The extensions are fields only present in
               version 3 certificates.

Table 4.2: X.509 certificate fields.

The certificate's _subject or issuer name_ is not just a single string.
It is a Distinguished name and in the ASN.1 notation is a sequence of
several object identifiers with their corresponding values. Some of
available OIDs to be used in an X.509 distinguished name are defined in
`gnutls/x509.h'.

The _Version_ field in a certificate has values either 1 or 3 for
version 3 certificates.  Version 1 certificates do not support the
extensions field so it is not possible to distinguish a CA from a
person, thus their usage should be avoided.

The _validity_ dates are there to indicate the date that the specific
certificate was activated and the date the certificate's key would be
considered invalid.

Certificate _extensions_ are there to include information about the
certificate's subject that did not fit in the typical certificate
fields. Those may be e-mail addresses, flags that indicate whether the
belongs to a CA etc.  All the supported X.509 version 3 extensions are
shown in *note tab:x509-ext::.

Table 4.3: X.509 certificate extensions.

In GnuTLS the X.509 certificate structures are handled using the
`gnutls_x509_crt_t' type and the corresponding private keys with the
`gnutls_x509_privkey_t' type.  All the available functions for X.509
certificate handling have their prototypes in `gnutls/x509.h'. An
example program to demonstrate the X.509 parsing capabilities can be
found in *note ex:x509-info::.

4.1.2 Importing an X.509 certificate
------------------------------------

The certificate structure should be initialized using *note
gnutls_x509_crt_init::, and a certificate structure can be imported
using *note gnutls_x509_crt_import::.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_init:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_import:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

`VOID *note gnutls_x509_crt_deinit:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT)'

In several functions an array of certificates is required. To assist in
initialization and import the following two functions are provided.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERTS, unsigned int * CERT_MAX, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t ** CERTS, unsigned int * SIZE, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

In all cases after use a certificate must be deinitialized using *note
gnutls_x509_crt_deinit::.  Note that although the functions above apply
to `gnutls_x509_crt_t' structure, similar functions exist for the CRL
structure `gnutls_x509_crl_t'.

4.1.3 X.509 distinguished names
-------------------------------

The "subject" of an X.509 certificate is not described by a single
name, but rather with a distinguished name. This in X.509 terminology
is a list of strings each associated an object identifier. To make
things simple GnuTLS provides *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn:: which
follows the rules in [_RFC4514_] and returns a single string. Access to
each string by individual object identifiers can be accessed using
*note gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, char
          * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)
     CERT: should contain a `gnutls_x509_crt_t'  structure

     BUF: a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)

     BUF_SIZE: initially holds the size of  `buf'

     This function will copy the name of the Certificate in the provided
     buffer. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as
     described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
     encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     If  `buf' is null then only the size will be filled.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER'  if the provided buffer
     is not long enough, and in that case the  `buf_size' will be
     updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid (gnutls_x509_crt_t
          CERT, const char * OID, int INDX, unsigned int RAW_FLAG, void
          * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)
     CERT: should contain a `gnutls_x509_crt_t'  structure

     OID: holds an Object Identified in null terminated string

     INDX: In case multiple same OIDs exist in the RDN, this specifies
     which to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

     RAW_FLAG: If non-zero returns the raw DER data of the DN part.

     BUF: a pointer where the DN part will be copied (may be null).

     BUF_SIZE: initially holds the size of  `buf'

     This function will extract the part of the name of the Certificate
     subject specified by the given OID. The output, if the raw flag is
     not used, will be encoded as described in RFC4514. Thus a string
     that is ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
     If raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as
     text. Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC4514 - in
     hex format with a '#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs
     using `gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()' .

     If  `buf' is null then only the size will be filled. If the
     `raw_flag' is not specified the output is always null terminated,
     although the  `buf_size' will not include the null character.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER'  if the provided buffer
     is not long enough, and in that case the  `buf_size' will be
     updated with the required size.
     `GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE'  if there are no data in
     the current index. On success 0 is returned.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_oid (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT,
          int INDX, void * OID, size_t * OID_SIZE)
     CERT: should contain a `gnutls_x509_crt_t'  structure

     INDX: This specifies which OID to return. Use (0) to get the first
     one.

     OID: a pointer to a buffer to hold the OID (may be null)

     OID_SIZE: initially holds the size of  `oid'

     This function will extract the OIDs of the name of the Certificate
     subject specified by the given index.

     If  `oid' is null then only the size will be filled. The  `oid'
     returned will be null terminated, although  `oid_size' will not
     account for the trailing null.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER'  if the provided buffer
     is not long enough, and in that case the  `buf_size' will be
     updated with the required size.
     `GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE'  if there are no data in
     the current index. On success 0 is returned.

Similar functions exist to access the distinguished name of the issuer
of the certificate.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, char * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_by_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const char * OID, int INDX, unsigned int RAW_FLAG, void * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, int INDX, void * OID, size_t * OID_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, gnutls_x509_dn_t * DN)'

4.1.4 Accessing public and private keys
---------------------------------------

Each X.509 certificate contains a public key that corresponds to a
private key. To get a unique identifier of the public key the *note
gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id:: function is provided. To export the public
key or its parameters you may need to convert the X.509 structure to a
`gnutls_pubkey_t'. See *note Abstract public keys:: for more
information.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT,
          unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned char * OUTPUT_DATA, size_t *
          OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE)
     CRT: Holds the certificate

     FLAGS: should be 0 for now

     OUTPUT_DATA: will contain the key ID

     OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE: holds the size of output_data (and will be
     replaced by the actual size of parameters)

     This function will return a unique ID that depends on the public
     key parameters. This ID can be used in checking whether a
     certificate corresponds to the given private key.

     If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
     *output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will
     be returned.  The output will normally be a SHA-1 hash output,
     which is 20 bytes.

     *Returns:* In case of failure a negative error code will be
     returned, and 0 on success.

The private key parameters may be directly accessed by using one of the
following functions.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_get_pk_algorithm2:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int * BITS)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_export_rsa_raw2:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_datum_t * M, gnutls_datum_t * E, gnutls_datum_t * D, gnutls_datum_t * P, gnutls_datum_t * Q, gnutls_datum_t * U, gnutls_datum_t * E1, gnutls_datum_t * E2)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_export_ecc_raw:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_ecc_curve_t * CURVE, gnutls_datum_t * X, gnutls_datum_t * Y, gnutls_datum_t* K)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_export_dsa_raw:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_datum_t * P, gnutls_datum_t * Q, gnutls_datum_t * G, gnutls_datum_t * Y, gnutls_datum_t * X)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_get_key_id:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned char * OUTPUT_DATA, size_t * OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE)'

4.1.5 Verifying X.509 certificate paths
---------------------------------------

Verifying certificate paths is important in X.509 authentication. For
this purpose the following functions are provided.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const gnutls_x509_crt_t *
          CLIST, int CLIST_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CLIST: A list of CAs

     CLIST_SIZE: The length of the CA list

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will add the given certificate authorities to the
     trusted list. The list of CAs must not be deinitialized during
     this structure's lifetime.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const
          void * NAME, size_t NAME_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CERT: A certificate

     NAME: An identifier for the certificate

     NAME_SIZE: The size of the identifier

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will add the given certificate to the trusted list
     and associate it with a name. The certificate will not be be used
     for verification with `gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt()' but
     only with `gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt()' .

     In principle this function can be used to set individual "server"
     certificates that are trusted by the user for that specific server
     but for no other purposes.

     The certificate must not be deinitialized during the lifetime of
     the trusted list.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const gnutls_x509_crl_t *
          CRL_LIST, int CRL_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned int
          VERIFICATION_FLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CRL_LIST: A list of CRLs

     CRL_SIZE: The length of the CRL list

     FLAGS: if GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL is given the CRLs will be verified
     before being added.

     VERIFICATION_FLAGS: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags
     specifies GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

     This function will add the given certificate revocation lists to
     the trusted list. The list of CRLs must not be deinitialized
     during this structure's lifetime.

     This function must be called after
     `gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas()' to allow verifying the CRLs for
     validity.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, gnutls_x509_crt_t *
          CERT_LIST, unsigned int CERT_LIST_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS,
          unsigned int * VERIFY, gnutls_verify_output_function FUNC)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CERT_LIST: is the certificate list to be verified

     CERT_LIST_SIZE: is the certificate list size

     FLAGS: Flags that may be used to change the verification
     algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags
     enumerations.

     VERIFY: will hold the certificate verification output.

     FUNC: If non-null will be called on each chain element
     verification with the output.

     This function will try to verify the given certificate and return
     its status. The  `verify' parameter will hold an OR'ed sequence of
     `gnutls_certificate_status_t'  flags.

     *Limitation:* Pathlen constraints or key usage flags are not
     consulted.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const
          void * NAME, size_t NAME_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned
          int * VERIFY, gnutls_verify_output_function FUNC)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CERT: is the certificate to be verified

     NAME: is the certificate's name

     NAME_SIZE: is the certificate's name size

     FLAGS: Flags that may be used to change the verification
     algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags
     enumerations.

     VERIFY: will hold the certificate verification output.

     FUNC: If non-null will be called on each chain element
     verification with the output.

     This function will try to find a certificate that is associated
     with the provided name -see
     `gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt()' . If a match is found the
     certificate is considered valid. In addition to that this function
     will also check CRLs. The  `verify' parameter will hold an OR'ed
     sequence of `gnutls_certificate_status_t'  flags.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_file
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const char* CA_FILE, const
          char* CRL_FILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, unsigned int
          TL_FLAGS, unsigned int TL_VFLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CA_FILE: A file containing a list of CAs (optional)

     CRL_FILE: A file containing a list of CRLs (optional)

     TYPE: The format of the certificates

     TL_FLAGS: GNUTLS_TL_*

     TL_VFLAGS: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies
     GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

     This function will add the given certificate authorities to the
     trusted list. pkcs11 URLs are also accepted, instead of files, by
     this function.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.1

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_mem
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const gnutls_datum_t * CAS,
          const gnutls_datum_t * CRLS, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE,

     This function will add the given certificate authorities to the
     trusted list.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.1

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_system_trust
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, unsigned int TL_FLAGS,
          unsigned int TL_VFLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     TL_FLAGS: GNUTLS_TL_*

     TL_VFLAGS: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies
     GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

     This function adds the system's default trusted certificate
     authorities to the trusted list. Note that on unsupported system
     this function returns `GNUTLS_E_UNIMPLEMENTED_FEATURE' .

     *Returns:* The number of added elements or a negative error code
     on error.

     *Since:* 3.1

The verification function will verify a given certificate chain against
a list of certificate authorities and certificate revocation lists, and
output a bit-wise OR of elements of the `gnutls_certificate_status_t'
enumeration shown in *note gnutls_certificate_status_t::. The
`GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID' flag is always set on a verification error and
more detailed flags will also be set when appropriate.

`GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID'
     The certificate is not signed by one of the known authorities or
     the signature is invalid (deprecated by the flags
     `GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE'  and
     `GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND' ).

`GNUTLS_CERT_REVOKED'
     Certificate is revoked by its authority.  In X.509 this will be
     set only if CRLs are checked.

`GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND'
     The certificate's issuer is not known.  This is the case if the
     issuer is not included in the trusted certificate list.

`GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_CA'
     The certificate's signer was not a CA. This may happen if this was
     a version 1 certificate, which is common with some CAs, or a
     version 3 certificate without the basic constrains extension.

`GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM'
     The certificate was signed using an insecure algorithm such as MD2
     or MD5. These algorithms have been broken and should not be
     trusted.

`GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED'
     The certificate is not yet activated.

`GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED'
     The certificate has expired.

`GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE'
     The signature verification failed.

`GNUTLS_CERT_REVOCATION_DATA_SUPERSEDED'
     The revocation data are old and have been superseded.

`GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER'
     The owner is not the expected one.

`GNUTLS_CERT_REVOCATION_DATA_ISSUED_IN_FUTURE'
     The revocation data have a future issue date.

`GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE'
     The certificate's signer constraints were violated.

Figure 4.2: The `gnutls_certificate_status_t' enumeration.

An example of certificate verification is shown in *note ex:verify2::.
It is also possible to have a set of certificates that are trusted for
a particular server but not to authorize other certificates.  This
purpose is served by the functions *note
gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt:: and *note
gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt::.

-----------------------------------------------------------

When operating in the context of a TLS session, the trusted certificate
authority list may also be set using:
`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CRLFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED)'

Then it is not required to setup a trusted list as above.  The function
*note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: may then be used to verify the
peer's certificate chain and identity. The flags are set similarly to
the verification functions in the previous section.

There is also the possibility to pass some input to the verification
functions in the form of flags. For *note
gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt:: the flags are passed
straightforward, but *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: depends
on the flags set by calling *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags::.  All the available flags are
part of the enumeration `gnutls_certificate_verify_flags' shown in
*note gnutls_certificate_verify_flags::.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CA_SIGN'
     If set a signer does not have to be a certificate authority. This
     flag should normaly be disabled, unless you know what this means.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT'
     Allow trusted CA certiﬁcates with version 1. This is safer than
     `GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT' , and should be used
     instead. That way only signers in your trusted list will be
     allowed to have certiﬁcates of version 1. This is the default.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_SAME'
     If a certificate is not signed by anyone trusted but exists in the
     trusted CA list do not treat it as trusted.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT'
     Allow CA certificates that have version 1 (both root and
     intermediate). This might be dangerous since those haven't the
     basicConstraints extension. Must be used in combination with
     `GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT' .

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2'
     Allow certificates to be signed using the broken MD2 algorithm.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5'
     Allow certificates to be signed using the broken MD5 algorithm.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS'
     Disable checking of activation and expiration validity periods of
     certificate chains. Don't set this unless you understand the
     security implications.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TRUSTED_TIME_CHECKS'
     If set a signer in the trusted list is never checked for
     expiration or activation.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT'
     Do not allow trusted CA certificates that have version 1.  This
     option is to be used to deprecate all certificates of version 1.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CRL_CHECKS'
     Disable checking for validity using certificate revocation lists
     or the available OCSP data.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN'
     A certificate chain is tolerated if unsorted (the case with many
     TLS servers out there). This is the default since GnuTLS 3.1.4.

`GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN'
     Do not tolerate an unsorted certificate chain.

4.2 OpenPGP certificates
========================

The OpenPGP key authentication relies on a distributed trust model,
called the "web of trust". The "web of trust" uses a decentralized
system of trusted introducers, which are the same as a CA. OpenPGP
allows anyone to sign anyone else's public key. When Alice signs Bob's
key, she is introducing Bob's key to anyone who trusts Alice. If
someone trusts Alice to introduce keys, then Alice is a trusted
introducer in the mind of that observer.  For example in *note
fig:openpgp::, David trusts Alice to be an introducer and Alice signed
Bob's key thus Dave trusts Bob's key to be the real one.

 [image src="gnutls-pgp.png" ]

Figure 4.4: An example of the OpenPGP trust model.

There are some key points that are important in that model. In the
example Alice has to sign Bob's key, only if she is sure that the key
belongs to Bob. Otherwise she may also make Dave falsely believe that
this is Bob's key. Dave has also the responsibility to know who to
trust.  This model is similar to real life relations.

Just see how Charlie behaves in the previous example. Although he has
signed Bob's key - because he knows, somehow, that it belongs to Bob -
he does not trust Bob to be an introducer. Charlie decided to trust
only Kevin, for some reason. A reason could be that Bob is lazy enough,
and signs other people's keys without being sure that they belong to
the actual owner.

Table 4.4: OpenPGP certificate fields.

4.2.1 OpenPGP certificate structure
-----------------------------------

In GnuTLS the OpenPGP certificate structures [_RFC2440_] are handled
using the `gnutls_openpgp_crt_t' type.  A typical certificate contains
the user ID, which is an RFC 2822 mail and name address, a public key,
possibly a number of additional public keys (called subkeys), and a
number of signatures. The various fields are shown in *note Table 4.4:
tab:openpgp-certificate.

The additional subkeys may provide key for various different purposes,
e.g. one key to encrypt mail, and another to sign a TLS key exchange.
Each subkey is identified by a unique key ID.  The keys that are to be
used in a TLS key exchange that requires signatures are called
authentication keys in the OpenPGP jargon.  The mapping of TLS key
exchange methods to public keys is shown in *note
tab:openpgp-key-exchange::.

Key exchange   Public key requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
RSA             An RSA public key that allows encryption.
DHE_RSA         An RSA public key that is marked for
               authentication.
ECDHE_RSA       An RSA public key that is marked for
               authentication.
DHE_DSS         A DSA public key that is marked for
               authentication.

Table 4.5: The types of (sub)keys required for the various TLS key
exchange methods.

The corresponding private keys are stored in the
`gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t' type. All the prototypes for the key
handling functions can be found in `gnutls/openpgp.h'.

4.2.2 Verifying an OpenPGP certificate
--------------------------------------

The verification functions of OpenPGP keys, included in GnuTLS, are
simple ones, and do not use the features of the "web of trust".  For
that reason, if the verification needs are complex, the assistance of
external tools like GnuPG and GPGME(1) is recommended.

In GnuTLS there is a verification function for OpenPGP certificates,
the *note gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_ring::.  This checks an OpenPGP key
against a given set of public keys (keyring) and returns the key
status. The key verification status is the same as in X.509
certificates, although the meaning and interpretation are different.
For example an OpenPGP key may be valid, if the self signature is ok,
even if no signers were found.  The meaning of verification status
flags is the same as in the X.509 certificates (see *note Figure 4.3:
gnutls_certificate_verify_flags.).

 -- Function: int gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_ring (gnutls_openpgp_crt_t
          KEY, gnutls_openpgp_keyring_t KEYRING, unsigned int FLAGS,
          unsigned int * VERIFY)
     KEY: the structure that holds the key.

     KEYRING: holds the keyring to check against

     FLAGS: unused (should be 0)

     VERIFY: will hold the certificate verification output.

     Verify all signatures in the key, using the given set of keys
     (keyring).

     The key verification output will be put in  `verify' and will be
     one or more of the `gnutls_certificate_status_t'  enumerated
     elements bitwise or'd.

     Note that this function does not verify using any "web of trust".
     You may use GnuPG for that purpose, or any other external PGP
     application.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  on success, or an error code.

 -- Function: int gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_self (gnutls_openpgp_crt_t
          KEY, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned int * VERIFY)
     KEY: the structure that holds the key.

     FLAGS: unused (should be 0)

     VERIFY: will hold the key verification output.

     Verifies the self signature in the key.  The key verification
     output will be put in  `verify' and will be one or more of the
     gnutls_certificate_status_t enumerated elements bitwise or'd.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  on success, or an error code.

4.2.3 Verifying a certificate in the context of a TLS session
-------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly with X.509 certificates, one needs to specify the OpenPGP
keyring file in the credentials structure. The certificates in this
file will be  used by *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: to
verify the signatures in the certificate sent by the peer.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t C, const char * FILE,
          gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)
     C: A certificate credentials structure

     FILE: filename of the keyring.

     FORMAT: format of keyring.

     The function is used to set keyrings that will be used internally
     by various OpenPGP functions. For example to find a key when it is
     needed for an operations. The keyring will also be used at the
     verification functions.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

4.3 Advanced certificate verification
=====================================

The verification of X.509 certificates in the HTTPS and other Internet
protocols is typically done by loading a trusted list of commercial
Certificate Authorities (see *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust::), and using them as trusted
anchors.  However, there are several examples (eg. the Diginotar
incident) where one of these authorities was compromised. This risk can
be mitigated by using in addition to CA certificate verification, other
verification methods. In this section we list the available in GnuTLS
methods.

* Verifying a certificate using trust on first use authentication::
* Verifying a certificate using DANE (DNSSEC)::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Verifying a certificate using trust on first use authentication,  Next: Verifying a certificate using DANE (DNSSEC),  Up: Advanced certificate verification

4.3.1 Verifying a certificate using trust on first use authentication
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to use a trust on first use (TOFU) authentication method
in GnuTLS. That is the concept used by the SSH programs, where the
public key of the peer is not verified, or verified in an out-of-bound
way, but subsequent connections to the same peer require the public key
to remain the same.  Such a system in combination with the typical CA
verification of a certificate, and OCSP revocation checks, can help to
provide multiple factor verification, where a single point of failure
is not enough to compromise the system. For example a server compromise
may be detected using OCSP, and a CA compromise can be detected using
the trust on first use method.  Such a hybrid system with X.509 and
trust on first use authentication is shown in *note Simple client
example with SSH-style certificate verification::.

See *note Certificate verification:: on how to use the available
functionality.

4.3.2 Verifying a certificate using DANE (DNSSEC)
-------------------------------------------------

The DANE protocol is a protocol that can be used to verify TLS
certificates using the DNS (or better DNSSEC) protocols. The DNS
security extensions (DNSSEC) provide an alternative public key
infrastructure to the commercial CAs that are typically used to sign
TLS certificates. The DANE protocol takes advantage of the DNSSEC
infrastructure to verify TLS certificates. This can be in addition to
the verification by CA infrastructure or may even replace it where
DNSSEC is fully deployed. Note however, that DNSSEC deployment is
fairly new and it would be better to use it as an additional
verification method rather than the only one.

The DANE functionality is provided by the `libgnutls-dane' library that
is shipped with GnuTLS and the function prototypes are in
`gnutls/dane.h'.  See *note Certificate verification:: for information
on how to use the library.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Digital signatures,  Prev: Advanced certificate verification,  Up: Certificate authentication

4.4 Digital signatures
======================

In this section we will provide some information about digital
signatures, how they work, and give the rationale for disabling some of
the algorithms used.

Digital signatures work by using somebody's secret key to sign some
arbitrary data.  Then anybody else could use the public key of that
person to verify the signature.  Since the data may be arbitrary it is
not suitable input to a cryptographic digital signature algorithm. For
this reason and also for performance cryptographic hash algorithms are
used to preprocess the input to the signature algorithm. This works as
long as it is difficult enough to generate two different messages with
the same hash algorithm output. In that case the same signature could
be used as a proof for both messages. Nobody wants to sign an innocent
message of donating 1 euro to Greenpeace and find out that he donated
1.000.000 euros to Bad Inc.

For a hash algorithm to be called cryptographic the following three
requirements must hold:

  1. Preimage resistance.  That means the algorithm must be one way and
     given the output of the hash function H(x), it is impossible to
     calculate x.

  2. 2nd preimage resistance.  That means that given a pair x,y with
     y=H(x) it is impossible to calculate an x' such that y=H(x').

  3. Collision resistance.  That means that it is impossible to
     calculate random x and x' such H(x')=H(x).

The last two requirements in the list are the most important in digital
signatures. These protect against somebody who would like to generate
two messages with the same hash output. When an algorithm is considered
broken usually it means that the Collision resistance of the algorithm
is less than brute force. Using the birthday paradox the brute force
attack takes 2^((hash size) / 2) operations. Today colliding
certificates using the MD5 hash algorithm have been generated as shown
in [_WEGER_].

There has been cryptographic results for the SHA-1 hash algorithms as
well, although they are not yet critical.  Before 2004, MD5 had a
presumed collision strength of 2^64, but it has been showed to have a
collision strength well under 2^50.  As of November 2005, it is
believed that SHA-1's collision strength is around 2^63.  We consider
this sufficiently hard so that we still support SHA-1.  We anticipate
that SHA-256/386/512 will be used in publicly-distributed certificates
in the future.  When 2^63 can be considered too weak compared to the
computer power available sometime in the future, SHA-1 will be disabled
as well.  The collision attacks on SHA-1 may also get better, given the
new interest in tools for creating them.

4.4.1 Trading security for interoperability
-------------------------------------------

If you connect to a server and use GnuTLS' functions to verify the
certificate chain, and get a `GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM'
validation error (see *note Verifying X.509 certificate paths::), it
means that somewhere in the certificate chain there is a certificate
signed using `RSA-MD2' or `RSA-MD5'.  These two digital signature
algorithms are considered broken, so GnuTLS fails verifying the
certificate.  In some situations, it may be useful to be able to verify
the certificate chain anyway, assuming an attacker did not utilize the
fact that these signatures algorithms are broken.  This section will
give help on how to achieve that.

It is important to know that you do not have to enable any of the flags
discussed here to be able to use trusted root CA certificates
self-signed using `RSA-MD2' or `RSA-MD5'. The certificates in the
trusted list are considered trusted irrespective of the signature.

If you are using *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: to verify the
certificate chain, you can call *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags:: with the flags:
   * `GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2'

   * `GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5'
as in the following example:

       gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags (x509cred,
                                            GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5);

This will signal the verifier algorithm to enable `RSA-MD5' when
verifying the certificates.

If you are using *note gnutls_x509_crt_verify:: or *note
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify::, you can pass the
`GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5' parameter directly in the `flags'
parameter.

If you are using these flags, it may also be a good idea to warn the
user when verification failure occur for this reason.  The simplest is
to not use the flags by default, and only fall back to using them after
warning the user.  If you wish to inspect the certificate chain
yourself, you can use *note gnutls_certificate_get_peers:: to extract
the raw server's certificate chain, *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import::
to parse each of the certificates, and then *note
gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature_algorithm:: to find out the signing
algorithm used for each certificate.  If any of the intermediary
certificates are using `GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_MD2' or `GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_MD5',
you could present a warning.

5.1.1 Authentication using SRP
------------------------------

GnuTLS supports authentication via the Secure Remote Password or SRP
protocol (see [_RFC2945,TOMSRP_] for a description).  The SRP key
exchange is an extension to the TLS protocol, and it provides an
authenticated with a password key exchange. The peers can be identified
using a single password, or there can be combinations where the client
is authenticated using SRP and the server using a certificate.

The advantage of SRP authentication, over other proposed secure
password authentication schemes, is that SRP is not susceptible to
off-line dictionary attacks.  Moreover, SRP does not require the server
to hold the user's password.  This kind of protection is similar to the
one used traditionally in the UNIX `/etc/passwd' file, where the
contents of this file did not cause harm to the system security if they
were revealed.  The SRP needs instead of the plain password something
called a verifier, which is calculated using the user's password, and
if stolen cannot be used to impersonate the user.

Typical conventions in SRP are a password file, called `tpasswd' that
holds the SRP verifiers (encoded passwords) and another file,
`tpasswd.conf', which holds the allowed SRP parameters.  The included
in GnuTLS helper follow those conventions. The srptool program,
discussed in the next section is a tool to manipulate the SRP
parameters.

The implementation in GnuTLS is based on [_TLSSRP_]. The supported key
exchange methods are shown below.

`SRP:'
     Authentication using the SRP protocol.

`SRP_DSS:'
     Client authentication using the SRP protocol. Server is
     authenticated using a certificate with DSA parameters.

`SRP_RSA:'
     Client authentication using the SRP protocol. Server is
     authenticated using a certificate with RSA parameters.

This command will check against a password. If the password matches the
one in `/etc/tpasswd' you will get an ok.
    $ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd --passwd\-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf --verify -u test

5.2.1 Authentication using PSK
------------------------------

Authentication using Pre-shared keys is a method to authenticate using
usernames and binary keys. This protocol avoids making use of public
key infrastructure and expensive calculations, thus it is suitable for
constraint clients.

The implementation in GnuTLS is based on [_TLSPSK_].  The supported PSK
key exchange methods are:

`PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol.

`DHE-PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol and Diffie-Hellman key
     exchange.  This method offers perfect forward secrecy.

`ECDHE-PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol and Elliptic curve
     Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  This method offers perfect forward
     secrecy.


Helper functions to generate and maintain PSK keys are also included in
GnuTLS.

5.3 Anonymous authentication
============================

The anonymous key exchange offers encryption without any indication of
the peer's identity.  This kind of authentication is vulnerable to a
man in the middle attack, but can be used even if there is no prior
communication or shared trusted parties with the peer. Moreover it is
useful when complete anonymity is required.  Unless in one of the above
cases, do not use anonymous authentication.

The available key exchange algorithms for anonymous authentication are
shown below, but note that few public servers support them. They
typically have to be explicitly enabled.

`ANON_DH:'
     This algorithm exchanges Diffie-Hellman parameters.

`ANON_ECDH:'
     This algorithm exchanges elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman parameters.
     It is more efficient than ANON_DH on equivalent security levels.

6.1 PKCS #10 certificate requests
=================================

A certificate request is a structure, which contain information about
an applicant of a certificate service.  It usually contains a private
key, a distinguished name and secondary data such as a challenge
password. GnuTLS supports the requests defined in PKCS #10 [_RFC2986_].
Other formats of certificate requests are not currently supported.

A certificate request can be generated by associating it with a private
key, setting the subject's information and finally self signing it.
The last step ensures that the requester is in possession of the
private key.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn_by_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ, const char * OID, unsigned int RAW_FLAG, const void * DATA, unsigned int SIZEOF_DATA)'

The *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_key:: and *note gnutls_x509_crq_sign2::
functions associate the request with a private key and sign it. If a
request is to be signed with a key residing in a PKCS #11 token it is
recommended to use the signing functions shown in *note Abstract key
types::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crq_set_key (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ,
          gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY)
     CRQ: should contain a `gnutls_x509_crq_t'  structure

     KEY: holds a private key

     This function will set the public parameters from the given private
     key to the request.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crq_sign2 (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ,
          gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIG,
          unsigned int FLAGS)
     CRQ: should contain a `gnutls_x509_crq_t'  structure

     KEY: holds a private key

     DIG: The message digest to use, i.e., `GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1'

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the certificate request with a private key.
     This must be the same key as the one used in
     `gnutls_x509_crt_set_key()'  since a certificate request is self
     signed.

     This must be the last step in a certificate request generation
     since all the previously set parameters are now signed.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  on success, otherwise a negative
     error code.  `GNUTLS_E_ASN1_VALUE_NOT_FOUND'  is returned if you
     didn't set all information in the certificate request (e.g., the
     version using `gnutls_x509_crq_set_version()' ).

The following example is about generating a certificate request, and a
private key. A certificate request can be later be processed by a CA

6.2 PKIX certificate revocation lists
=====================================

A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a structure issued by an
authority periodically containing a list of revoked certificates serial
numbers.  The CRL structure is signed with the issuing authorities'
keys. A typical CRL contains the fields as shown in *note tab:crl::.
Certificate revocation lists are used to complement the expiration date
of a certificate, in order to account for other reasons of revocation,
such as compromised keys, etc.

Each CRL is valid for limited amount of time and is required to
provide, except for the current issuing time, also the issuing time of
the next update.

Field          Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
version         The field that indicates the version of the CRL
               structure.
signature       A signature by the issuing authority.
issuer          Holds the issuer's distinguished name.
thisUpdate      The issuing time of the revocation list.
nextUpdate      The issuing time of the revocation list that
               will update that one.
revokedCertificates List of revoked certificates serial numbers.
extensions      Optional CRL structure extensions.

Table 6.1: Certificate revocation list fields.

The basic CRL structure functions follow.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_init:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t * CRL)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_import:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

Reading a CRL
-------------

The most important function that extracts the certificate revocation
information from a CRL is *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial::. Other
functions that return other fields of the CRL structure are also
provided.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial (gnutls_x509_crl_t
          CRL, int INDX, unsigned char * SERIAL, size_t * SERIAL_SIZE,
          time_t * T)
     CRL: should contain a `gnutls_x509_crl_t'  structure

     INDX: the index of the certificate to extract (starting from 0)

     SERIAL: where the serial number will be copied

     SERIAL_SIZE: initially holds the size of serial

     T: if non null, will hold the time this certificate was revoked

     This function will retrieve the serial number of the specified, by
     the index, revoked certificate.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value. and a negative error code on
     error.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_version:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn:: (const gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, char * BUF, size_t * SIZEOF_BUF)'

`TIME_T *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_this_update:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'

`TIME_T *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_next_update:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_count:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_this_update:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, time_t ACT_TIME)'

The *note gnutls_x509_crl_sign2:: and *note
gnutls_x509_crl_privkey_sign:: functions sign the revocation list with
a private key. The latter function can be used to sign with a key
residing in a PKCS #11 token.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crl_sign2 (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t ISSUER, gnutls_x509_privkey_t ISSUER_KEY,
          gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIG, unsigned int FLAGS)
     CRL: should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t structure

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     DIG: The message digest to use. GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1 is the safe choice
     unless you know what you're doing.

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the CRL with the issuer's private key, and
     will copy the issuer's information into the CRL.

     This must be the last step in a certificate CRL since all the
     previously set parameters are now signed.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

          gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIG, unsigned int FLAGS)
     CRL: should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t structure

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     DIG: The message digest to use. GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1 is the safe choice
     unless you know what you're doing.

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the CRL with the issuer's private key, and
     will copy the issuer's information into the CRL.

     This must be the last step in a certificate CRL since all the
     previously set parameters are now signed.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     Since 2.12.0

6.3 OCSP certificate status checking
====================================

Certificates may be revoked before their expiration time has been
reached.  There are several reasons for revoking certificates, but a
typical situation is when the private key associated with a certificate
has been compromised.  Traditionally, Certificate Revocation Lists
(CRLs) have been used by application to implement revocation checking,
however, several problems with CRLs have been identified [_RIVESTCRL_].

The Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OCSP [_RFC2560_], is a
widely implemented protocol to perform certificate revocation status
checking.  An application that wish to verify the identity of a peer
will verify the certificate against a set of trusted certificates and
then check whether the certificate is listed in a CRL and/or perform an
OCSP check for the certificate.

Note that in the context of a TLS session the server may provide an
OCSP response that will used during the TLS certificate verification
(see *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3::).  You may obtain this
response using *note gnutls_ocsp_status_request_get::.

Before performing the OCSP query, the application will need to figure
out the address of the OCSP server.  The OCSP server address can be
provided by the local user in manual configuration or may be stored in
the certificate that is being checked.  When stored in a certificate
the OCSP server is in the extension field called the Authority
Information Access (AIA). The following function extracts this
information from a certificate.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int SEQ, int WHAT, gnutls_datum_t * DATA, unsigned int * CRITICAL)'

There are several functions in GnuTLS for creating and manipulating
OCSP requests and responses.  The general idea is that a client
application create an OCSP request object, store some information about
the certificate to check in the request, and then export the request in
DER format.  The request will then need to be sent to the OCSP
responder, which needs to be done by the application (GnuTLS does not
send and receive OCSP packets).  Normally an OCSP response is received
that the application will need to import into an OCSP response object.
The digital signature in the OCSP response needs to be verified against
a set of trust anchors before the information in the response can be
trusted.

The ASN.1 structure of OCSP requests are briefly as follows.  It is
useful to review the structures to get an understanding of which fields
are modified by GnuTLS functions.

    OCSPRequest     ::=     SEQUENCE {
        tbsRequest                  TBSRequest,
        optionalSignature   [0]     EXPLICIT Signature OPTIONAL }

    TBSRequest      ::=     SEQUENCE {
        version             [0]     EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
        requestorName       [1]     EXPLICIT GeneralName OPTIONAL,
        requestList                 SEQUENCE OF Request,
        requestExtensions   [2]     EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL }

    Request         ::=     SEQUENCE {
        reqCert                     CertID,
        singleRequestExtensions     [0] EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL }

    CertID          ::=     SEQUENCE {
        hashAlgorithm       AlgorithmIdentifier,
        issuerNameHash      OCTET STRING, -- Hash of Issuer's DN
        issuerKeyHash       OCTET STRING, -- Hash of Issuers public key
        serialNumber        CertificateSerialNumber }

The basic functions to initialize, import, export and deallocate OCSP
requests are the following.

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_init:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t * REQ)'

`VOID *note gnutls_ocsp_req_deinit:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_import:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_export:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_print:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_ocsp_print_formats_t FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)'

To generate an OCSP request the issuer name hash, issuer key hash, and
the checked certificate's serial number are required. There are two
interfaces available for setting those in an OCSP request.  The is a
low-level function when you have the issuer name hash, issuer key hash,
and certificate serial number in binary form.  The second is more
useful if you have the certificate (and its issuer) in a
`gnutls_x509_crt_t' type.  There is also a function to extract this
information from existing an OCSP request.

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert_id:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIGEST, const gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_NAME_HASH, const gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_KEY_HASH, const gnutls_datum_t * SERIAL_NUMBER)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIGEST, gnutls_x509_crt_t ISSUER, gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT)'

Each OCSP request may contain a number of extensions.  Extensions are
identified by an Object Identifier (OID) and an opaque data buffer
whose syntax and semantics is implied by the OID. You can extract or
set those extensions using the following functions.

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_get_extension:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, unsigned INDX, gnutls_datum_t * OID, unsigned int * CRITICAL, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_set_extension:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, const char * OID, unsigned int CRITICAL, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

A common OCSP Request extension is the nonce extension (OID
1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.2), which is used to avoid replay attacks of earlier
recorded OCSP responses.  The nonce extension carries a value that is
intended to be sufficiently random and unique so that an attacker will
not be able to give a stale response for the same nonce.

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_get_nonce:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, unsigned int * CRITICAL, gnutls_datum_t * NONCE)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_set_nonce:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, unsigned int CRITICAL, const gnutls_datum_t * NONCE)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_randomize_nonce:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ)'

The OCSP response structures is a complex structure. A simplified
overview of it is in *note tab:ocsp-response::. Note that a response
may contain information on multiple certificates.

thisUpdate      The issuing time of the revocation information.
nextUpdate      The issuing time of the revocation information
               that will update that one.

Table 6.2: The most important OCSP response fields.

We provide basic functions for initialization, importing, exporting and
deallocating OCSP responses.

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_init:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t * RESP)'

`VOID *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_deinit:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_import:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_export:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

`INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_print:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP, gnutls_ocsp_print_formats_t FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)'

The utility function that extracts the revocation as well as other
information from a response is shown below.

 -- Function: int gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_single (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP,
          unsigned INDX, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * DIGEST,
          gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_NAME_HASH, gnutls_datum_t *
          ISSUER_KEY_HASH, gnutls_datum_t * SERIAL_NUMBER, unsigned int
          * CERT_STATUS, time_t * THIS_UPDATE, time_t * NEXT_UPDATE,
          time_t * REVOCATION_TIME, unsigned int * REVOCATION_REASON)
     RESP: should contain a `gnutls_ocsp_resp_t'  structure

     INDX: Specifies response number to get. Use (0) to get the first
     one.

     DIGEST: output variable with `gnutls_digest_algorithm_t'  hash
     algorithm

     ISSUER_NAME_HASH: output buffer with hash of issuer's DN

     ISSUER_KEY_HASH: output buffer with hash of issuer's public key

     SERIAL_NUMBER: output buffer with serial number of certificate to
     check

     CERT_STATUS: a certificate status, a `gnutls_ocsp_cert_status_t'
     enum.

     THIS_UPDATE: time at which the status is known to be correct.

     NEXT_UPDATE: when newer information will be available, or
     (time_t)-1 if unspecified

     REVOCATION_TIME: when  `cert_status' is `GNUTLS_OCSP_CERT_REVOKED'
     , holds time of revocation.

     REVOCATION_REASON: revocation reason, a `gnutls_x509_crl_reason_t'
     enum.

     This function will return the certificate information of the
     `indx' 'ed response in the Basic OCSP Response  `resp' .  The
     information returned corresponds to the OCSP SingleResponse
     structure except the final singleExtensions.

     Each of the pointers to output variables may be NULL to indicate
     that the caller is not interested in that value.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached
     the last CertID available `GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE'
     will be returned.

The possible revocation reasons available in an OCSP response are shown
below.

`GNUTLS_X509_CRLREASON_UNSPECIFIED'
     Unspecified reason.

`GNUTLS_X509_CRLREASON_KEYCOMPROMISE'

Note, that the OCSP response needs to be verified against some set of
trust anchors before it can be relied upon. It is also important to
check whether the received OCSP response corresponds to the certificate
being checked.

6.4 Managing encrypted keys
===========================

Transferring or storing private keys in plain may not be a good idea,
since any compromise is irreparable.  Storing the keys in hardware
security modules (see *note Smart cards and HSMs::) could solve the
storage problem but it is not always practical or efficient enough.
This section describes ways to store and transfer encrypted private
keys.

There are methods for key encryption, namely the PKCS #8, PKCS #12 and
OpenSSL's custom encrypted private key formats.  The PKCS #8 and the
OpenSSL's method allow encryption of the private key, while the PKCS
#12 method allows, in addition, the bundling of accompanying data into
the structure. That is typically the corresponding certificate, as well
as a trusted CA certificate.

High level functionality
------------------------

Generic and higher level private key import functions are available,
that import plain or encrypted keys and will auto-detect the encrypted
key format.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_privkey_import2 (gnutls_x509_privkey_t
          KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t
          FORMAT, const char* PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)
     KEY: The structure to store the parsed key

     DATA: The DER or PEM encoded key.

     FORMAT: One of DER or PEM

     PASSWORD: A password (optional)

     FLAGS: an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

     This function will import the given DER or PEM encoded key, to the
     native `gnutls_x509_privkey_t'  format, irrespective of the input
     format. The input format is auto-detected.

     The supported formats are typical X.509, PKCS `8'  and the openssl
     format.

     If the provided key is encrypted but no password was given, then
     `GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED'  is returned.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

 -- Function: int gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw (gnutls_privkey_t
          PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t
          FORMAT, const char* PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PKEY: The private key

     DATA: The private key data to be imported

     FORMAT: The format of the private key

     PASSWORD: A password (optional)

     FLAGS: an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     `gnutls_privkey_t'  structure.

     The supported formats are typical X.509, PKCS `8'  and the openssl
     format.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

PKCS #8 structures
------------------

PKCS #8 keys can be imported and exported as normal private keys using
the functions below. An addition to the normal import functions, are a
password and a flags argument. The flags can be any element of the
`gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t' enumeration. Note however, that GnuTLS
only supports the PKCS #5 PBES2 encryption scheme. Keys encrypted with
the obsolete PBES1 scheme cannot be decrypted.

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_export_pkcs8:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS, void * OUTPUT_DATA, size_t * OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_export2_pkcs8:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)'

`GNUTLS_PKCS_PLAIN'
     Unencrypted private key.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PKCS12_3DES'
     PKCS-12 3DES.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PKCS12_ARCFOUR'
     PKCS-12 ARCFOUR.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PKCS12_RC2_40'
     PKCS-12 RC2-40.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_3DES'
     PBES2 3DES.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_128'
     PBES2 AES-128.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_192'
     PBES2 AES-192.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_256'
     PBES2 AES-256.

`GNUTLS_PKCS_NULL_PASSWORD'
     Some schemas distinguish between an empty and a NULL password.

Figure 6.2: Encryption flags

PKCS #12 structures
-------------------

A PKCS #12 structure [_PKCS12_] usually contains a user's private keys
and certificates. It is commonly used in browsers to export and import
the user's identities.

In GnuTLS the PKCS #12 structures are handled using the
`gnutls_pkcs12_t' type. This is an abstract type that may hold several
`gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t' types.  The bag types are the holders of the
actual data, which may be certificates, private keys or encrypted data.
A bag of type encrypted should be decrypted in order for its data to be
accessed.

To reduce the complexity in parsing the structures the simple helper
function *note gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse:: is provided. For more
advanced uses, manual parsing of the structure is required using the
functions below.

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs12_get_bag:: (gnutls_pkcs12_t PKCS12, int INDX, gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t BAG)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs12_verify_mac:: (gnutls_pkcs12_t PKCS12, const char * PASS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs12_bag_decrypt:: (gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t BAG, const char * PASS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs12_bag_get_count:: (gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t BAG)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse (gnutls_pkcs12_t P12,
          const char * PASSWORD, gnutls_x509_privkey_t * KEY,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t ** CHAIN, unsigned int * CHAIN_LEN,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t ** EXTRA_CERTS, unsigned int *
          EXTRA_CERTS_LEN, gnutls_x509_crl_t * CRL, unsigned int FLAGS)
     P12: the PKCS`12'  blob.

     PASSWORD: optional password used to decrypt PKCS`12'  blob, bags
     and keys.

     KEY: a structure to store the parsed private key.

     CHAIN: the corresponding to key certificate chain

     CHAIN_LEN: will be updated with the number of additional

     EXTRA_CERTS: optional pointer to receive an array of additional
     certificates found in the PKCS`12'  blob.

     EXTRA_CERTS_LEN: will be updated with the number of additional
     certs.

     CRL: an optional structure to store the parsed CRL.

     FLAGS: should be zero or one of GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_*

     This function parses a PKCS`12'  blob in  `p12blob' and extracts
     the private key, the corresponding certificate chain, and any
     additional certificates and a CRL.

     The  `extra_certs_ret' and  `extra_certs_ret_len' parameters are
     optional and both may be set to `NULL' . If either is non-`NULL' ,
     then both must be.

     Encrypted PKCS`12'  bags and PKCS`8'  private keys are supported.
     However, only password based security, and the same password for
     all operations, are supported.

     PKCS`12'  file may contain many keys and/or certificates, and there
     is no way to identify which key/certificate pair you want.  You
     should make sure the PKCS`12'  file only contain one
     key/certificate pair and/or one CRL.

     It is believed that the limitations of this function is acceptable
     for most usage, and that any more flexibility would introduce
     complexity that would make it harder to use this functionality at
     all.

     If the provided structure has encrypted fields but no password is
     provided then this function returns `GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED' .

     Note that normally the chain constructed does not include self
     signed certificates, to comply with TLS' requirements. If,
     however, the flag `GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_INCLUDE_SELF_SIGNED'  is
     specified then self signed certificates will be included in the
     chain.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1

OpenSSL encrypted keys
----------------------

Unfortunately the structures discussed in the previous sections are not
the only structures that may hold an encrypted private key. For example
the OpenSSL library offers a custom key encryption method. Those
structures are also supported in GnuTLS with *note
gnutls_x509_privkey_import_openssl::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_privkey_import_openssl
          (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA,
          const char* PASSWORD)
     KEY: The structure to store the parsed key

     DATA: The DER or PEM encoded key.

     PASSWORD: the password to decrypt the key (if it is encrypted).

     This function will convert the given PEM encrypted to the native
     gnutls_x509_privkey_t format. The output will be stored in  `key' .

     The  `password' should be in ASCII. If the password is not provided
     or wrong then `GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED'  will be returned.

     If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of
     "PRIVATE KEY" and the "DEK-Info" header.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

6.5 Invoking certtool
=====================

Tool to parse and generate X.509 certificates, requests and private
keys.  It can be used interactively or non interactively by specifying
the template command line option.

This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the `agtexi-cmd'
template and the option descriptions for the `certtool' program.  This
software is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or
later.

certtool help/usage (-h)
------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for certtool.  The text
printed is the same whether for the `help' option (-h) or the
`more-help' option (-!).  `more-help' will print the usage text by
passing it through a pager program.  `more-help' is disabled on
platforms without a working `fork(2)' function.  The `PAGER'
environment variable is used to select the program, defaulting to
`more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

certtool Examples
-----------------

Generating private keys
-----------------------

To create an RSA private key, run:
    $ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile key.pem --rsa

To create a DSA or elliptic curves (ECDSA) private key use the above
command combined with 'dsa' or 'ecc' options.

Generating certificate requests
-------------------------------

To create a certificate request (needed when the certificate is  issued
by another party), run:
    certtool --generate-request --load-privkey key.pem \
       --outfile request.pem

If the private key is stored in a smart card you can generate a request
by specifying the private key object URL.
    $ ./certtool --generate-request --load-privkey "pkcs11:..." \
      --load-pubkey "pkcs11:..." --outfile request.pem

Generating a self-signed certificate
------------------------------------

To create a self signed certificate, use the command:
    $ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem
    $ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem \
       --outfile ca-cert.pem

Note that a self-signed certificate usually belongs to a certificate
authority, that signs other certificates.

Generating a certificate
------------------------

To generate a certificate using the previous request, use the command:
    $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-request request.pem \
       --outfile cert.pem --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
       --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

To generate a certificate using the private key only, use the command:
    $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey key.pem \
       --outfile cert.pem --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
       --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

Certificate information
-----------------------

To view the certificate information, use:
    $ certtool --certificate-info --infile cert.pem

PKCS #12 structure generation
-----------------------------

To generate a PKCS #12 structure using the previous key and certificate,
use the command:
    $ certtool --load-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem \
       --to-p12 --outder --outfile key.p12

Some tools (reportedly web browsers) have problems with that file
because it does not contain the CA certificate for the certificate.  To
work around that problem in the tool, you can use the
-load-ca-certificate parameter as follows:

    $ certtool --load-ca-certificate ca.pem \
      --load-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem \
      --to-p12 --outder --outfile key.p12

Diffie-Hellman parameter generation
-----------------------------------

To generate parameters for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, use the command:
    $ certtool --generate-dh-params --outfile dh.pem --sec-param normal

Proxy certificate generation
----------------------------

Proxy certificate can be used to delegate your credential to a
temporary, typically short-lived, certificate.  To create one from the
previously created certificate, first create a temporary key and then
generate a proxy certificate for it, using the commands:

    $ certtool --generate-privkey > proxy-key.pem
    $ certtool --generate-proxy --load-ca-privkey key.pem \
      --load-privkey proxy-key.pem --load-certificate cert.pem \
      --outfile proxy-cert.pem

Certificate revocation list generation
--------------------------------------

To create an empty Certificate Revocation List (CRL) do:

    $ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
               --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem

To create a CRL that contains some revoked certificates, place the
certificates in a file and use `--load-certificate' as follows:

    $ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
      --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-certificate revoked-certs.pem

To verify a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) do:

    $ certtool --verify-crl --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem < crl.pem

certtool Files
--------------

Certtool's template file format
-------------------------------

A template file can be used to avoid the interactive questions of
certtool. Initially create a file named 'cert.cfg' that contains the
information about the certificate. The template can be used as below:

    $ certtool --generate-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem  \
       --template cert.cfg \
       --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

An example certtool template file that can be used to generate a
certificate request or a self signed certificate follows.

6.6 Invoking ocsptool
=====================

Ocsptool is a program that can parse and print information about OCSP
requests/responses, generate requests and verify responses.

This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the `agtexi-cmd'
template and the option descriptions for the `ocsptool' program.  This
software is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or
later.

ocsptool help/usage (-h)
------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for ocsptool.  The text
printed is the same whether for the `help' option (-h) or the
`more-help' option (-!).  `more-help' will print the usage text by
passing it through a pager program.  `more-help' is disabled on
platforms without a working `fork(2)' function.  The `PAGER'
environment variable is used to select the program, defaulting to
`more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

Ocsptool is a program that can parse and print information about OCSP
requests/responses, generate requests and verify responses.

please send bug reports to:  bug-gnutls@gnu.org

debug option (-d)
-----------------

This is the "enable debugging." option.  This option takes an argument
number.  Specifies the debug level.

ask option
----------

This is the "ask an ocsp/http server on a certificate validity" option.
This option takes an optional argument string `server name|url'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must appear in combination with the following options: load-cert,
     load-issuer.

Connects to the specified HTTP OCSP server and queries on the validity
of the loaded certificate.

ocsptool exit status
--------------------

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.

`1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

ocsptool Examples
-----------------

Print information about an OCSP request
---------------------------------------

To parse an OCSP request and print information about the content, the
`-i' or `--request-info' parameter may be used as follows.  The `-Q'
parameter specify the name of the file containing the OCSP request, and
it should contain the OCSP request in binary DER format.

    $ ocsptool -i -Q ocsp-request.der

The input file may also be sent to standard input like this:

    $ cat ocsp-request.der | ocsptool --request-info

Print information about an OCSP response
----------------------------------------

Similar to parsing OCSP requests, OCSP responses can be parsed using
the `-j' or `--response-info' as follows.

    $ ocsptool -j -Q ocsp-response.der
    $ cat ocsp-response.der | ocsptool --response-info

Generate an OCSP request
------------------------

The `-q' or `--generate-request' parameters are used to generate an
OCSP request.  By default the OCSP request is written to standard
output in binary DER format, but can be stored in a file using
`--outfile'.  To generate an OCSP request the issuer of the certificate
to check needs to be specified with `--load-issuer' and the certificate
to check with `--load-cert'.  By default PEM format is used for these
files, although `--inder' can be used to specify that the input files
are in DER format.

    $ ocsptool -q --load-issuer issuer.pem --load-cert client.pem \
               --outfile ocsp-request.der

When generating OCSP requests, the tool will add an OCSP extension
containing a nonce.  This behaviour can be disabled by specifying
`--no-nonce'.

Verify signature in OCSP response
---------------------------------

To verify the signature in an OCSP response the `-e' or
`--verify-response' parameter is used.  The tool will read an OCSP
response in DER format from standard input, or from the file specified
by `--load-response'.  The OCSP response is verified against a set of
trust anchors, which are specified using `--load-trust'.  The trust
anchors are concatenated certificates in PEM format.  The certificate
that signed the OCSP response needs to be in the set of trust anchors,
or the issuer of the signer certificate needs to be in the set of trust
anchors and the OCSP Extended Key Usage bit has to be asserted in the
signer certificate.

    $ ocsptool -e --load-trust issuer.pem \
               --load-response ocsp-response.der

The tool will print status of verification.

Verify signature in OCSP response against given certificate
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to override the normal trust logic if you know that a
certain certificate is supposed to have signed the OCSP response, and
you want to use it to check the signature.  This is achieved using
`--load-signer' instead of `--load-trust'.  This will load one
certificate and it will be used to verify the signature in the OCSP
response.  It will not check the Extended Key Usage bit.

    $ ocsptool -e --load-signer ocsp-signer.pem \
               --load-response ocsp-response.der

This approach is normally only relevant in two situations.  The first
is when the OCSP response does not contain a copy of the signer
certificate, so the `--load-trust' code would fail.  The second is if
you want to avoid the indirect mode where the OCSP response signer
certificate is signed by a trust anchor.

Real-world example
------------------

Here is an example of how to generate an OCSP request for a certificate
and to verify the response.  For illustration we'll use the
`blog.josefsson.org' host, which (as of writing) uses a certificate
from CACert.  First we'll use `gnutls-cli' to get a copy of the server
certificate chain.  The server is not required to send this
information, but this particular one is configured to do so.

    $ echo | gnutls-cli -p 443 blog.josefsson.org --print-cert > chain.pem

Use a text editor on `chain.pem' to create three files for each
separate certificates, called `cert.pem' for the first certificate for
the domain itself, secondly `issuer.pem' for the intermediate
certificate and `root.pem' for the final root certificate.

The domain certificate normally contains a pointer to where the OCSP
responder is located, in the Authority Information Access Information
extension.  For example, from `certtool -i < cert.pem' there is this
information:

    Authority Information Access Information (not critical):
    Access Method: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 (id-ad-ocsp)
    Access Location URI: http://ocsp.CAcert.org/

This means the CA support OCSP queries over HTTP.  We are now ready to
create a OCSP request for the certificate.

    $ ocsptool --ask ocsp.CAcert.org --load-issuer issuer.pem \
               --load-cert cert.pem --outfile ocsp-response.der

The request is sent via HTTP to the OCSP server address specified. If
the address is ommited ocsptool will use the address stored in the
certificate.

inder option
------------

This is the "use der format for input certificates and private keys."
option.  The input files will be assumed to be in DER or RAW format.
Unlike options that in PEM input would allow multiple input data (e.g.
multiple certificates), when reading in DER format a single data
structure is read.

inraw option
------------

This is an alias for the inder option, *note the inder option
documentation: danetool inder.

tlsa-rr option
--------------

This is the "print the dane rr data on a certificate or public key"
option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must appear in combination with the following options: host.

This command prints the DANE RR data needed to enable DANE on a DNS
server.

host option
-----------

This is the "specify the hostname to be used in the dane rr" option.
This option takes an argument string `Hostname'.  This command sets the
hostname for the DANE RR.

proto option
------------

This is the "the protocol set for dane data (tcp, udp etc.)" option.
This option takes an argument string `Protocol'.  This command

contain the hash of the full X.509 certificate. By default only the
hash of the public key is used.

local option
------------

This is the "the provided certificate or public key is a local entity."
option.  DANE distinguishes certificates and public keys offered via
the DNSSEC to trusted and local entities. Use this flag if this is a
local (and possibly unsigned) entity.

danetool exit status
--------------------

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.

`1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

danetool Examples
-----------------

DANE TLSA RR generation
-----------------------

To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a CA signed certificate use
the following commands.

    $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem

For a self signed certificate use:
    $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem \
      --local

The latter is useful to add in your DNS entry even if your certificate
is signed by a CA. That way even users who do not trust your CA will be
able to verify your certificate using DANE.

In order to create a record for the signer of your certificate use:
    $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem \
      --ca

To read a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
    $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443

To verify a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
    $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443 --load-certificate chain.pem

7 Hardware security modules and abstract key types
**************************************************

In several cases storing the long term cryptographic keys in a hard
disk or even in memory poses a significant risk. Once the system they
are stored is compromised the keys must be replaced as the secrecy of
future sessions is no longer guarranteed. Moreover, past sessions that
were not protected by a perfect forward secrecy offering ciphersuite
are also to be assumed compromised.

If such threats need to be addressed, then it may be wise storing the
keys in a security module such as a smart card, an HSM or the TPM chip.
Those modules ensure the protection of the cryptographic keys by only
allowing operations on them and preventing their extraction.

7.1 Abstract key types
======================

Since there are many forms of a public or private keys supported by
GnuTLS such as X.509, OpenPGP, PKCS #11 or TPM it is desirable to allow
common operations on them. For these reasons the abstract
`gnutls_privkey_t' and `gnutls_pubkey_t' were introduced in
`gnutls/abstract.h' header. Those types are initialized using a
specific type of key and then can be used to perform operations in an
abstract way. For example in order to sign an X.509 certificate with a
key that resides in a token the following steps must be used.

    #inlude <gnutls/abstract.h>

    void sign_cert( gnutls_x509_crt_t to_be_signed)
    {
    gnutls_x509_crt_t ca_cert;
    gnutls_privkey_t abs_key;

      /* initialize the abstract key */
      gnutls_privkey_init(&abs_key);

      /* keys stored in tokens are identified by URLs */
      gnutls_privkey_import_url(abs_key, key_url);

      gnutls_x509_crt_init(&ca_cert);
      gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url(&ca_cert, cert_url);

      /* sign the certificate to be signed */
      gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign(to_be_signed, ca_cert, abs_key,
                                   GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256, 0);

7.1.1 Public keys
-----------------

An abstract `gnutls_pubkey_t' can be initialized using the functions
below. It can be imported through an existing structure like
`gnutls_x509_crt_t', or through an ASN.1 encoding of the X.509
`SubjectPublicKeyInfo' sequence.

`INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_x509:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

          gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)
     KEY: Holds the certificate

     FORMAT: the format of output params. One of PEM or DER.

     OUT: will contain a certificate PEM or DER encoded

     This function will export the public key to DER or PEM format.
     The contents of the exported data is the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
     X.509 structure.

     The output buffer will be allocated using `gnutls_malloc()' .

     If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN
     CERTIFICATE".

     *Returns:* In case of failure a negative error code will be
     returned, and 0 on success.

     *Since:* 3.1.3

Other helper functions that allow directly importing from raw X.509 or
OpenPGP structures are shown below.

`INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

An important function is *note gnutls_pubkey_import_url:: which will
import public keys from URLs that identify objects stored in tokens
(see *note Smart cards and HSMs:: and *note Trusted Platform Module::).
A function to check for a supported by GnuTLS URL is *note
gnutls_url_is_supported::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_url_is_supported (const char* URL)
     URL: A PKCS 11 url

     Check whether url is supported.  Depending on the system libraries
     GnuTLS may support pkcs11 or tpmkey URLs.

     *Returns:* return non-zero if the given URL is supported, and zero
     if it is not known.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

Additional functions are available that will return information over a
public key, as well as a function that given a public key fingerprint
would provide a memorable sketch.

7.1.2 Private keys
------------------

An abstract `gnutls_privkey_t' can be initialized using the functions
below. It can be imported through an existing structure like
`gnutls_x509_privkey_t', but unlike public keys it cannot be exported.
That is to allow abstraction over keys stored in hardware that makes
available only operations.

`INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_pkcs11:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int FLAGS)'

Other helper functions that allow directly importing from raw X.509 or
OpenPGP structures are shown below. Again, as with public keys, private
keys can be imported from a hardware module using URLs.

`INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char* PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'

     KEY: A key of type `gnutls_privkey_t'

     URL: A PKCS 11 url

     FLAGS: should be zero

     This function will import a PKCS11 or TPM URL as a private key.
     The supported URL types can be checked using
     `gnutls_url_is_supported()' .

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

`INT *note gnutls_privkey_get_pk_algorithm:: (gnutls_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int * BITS)'

`GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_TYPE_T *note gnutls_privkey_get_type:: (gnutls_privkey_t KEY)'

In order to support cryptographic operations using an external API, the
following function is provided.  This allows for a simple extensibility
API without resorting to PKCS #11.

     PKEY: The private key

     PK: The public key algorithm

     USERDATA: private data to be provided to the callbacks

     SIGN_FUNC: callback for signature operations

     DECRYPT_FUNC: callback for decryption operations

     DEINIT_FUNC: a deinitialization function

     FLAGS: Flags for the import

     This function will associate the given callbacks with the
     `gnutls_privkey_t'  structure. At least one of the two callbacks
     must be non-null. If a deinitialization function is provided then
     flags is assumed to contain `GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_IMPORT_AUTO_RELEASE' .

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

7.2 Smart cards and HSMs
========================

In this section we present the smart-card and hardware security module
(HSM) support in GnuTLS using PKCS #11 [_PKCS11_]. Hardware security
modules and smart cards provide a way to store private keys and perform
operations on them without exposing them. This decouples cryptographic
keys from the applications that use them and provide an additional
security layer against cryptographic key extraction.  Since this can
also be achieved in software components such as in Gnome keyring, we
will use the term security module to describe any cryptographic key
separation subsystem.

PKCS #11 is plugin API allowing applications to access cryptographic
operations on a security module, as well as to objects residing on it.
PKCS #11 modules exist for hardware tokens such as smart cards(1),
cryptographic tokens, as well as for software modules like Gnome
Keyring.  The objects residing on a security module may be
certificates, public keys, private keys or secret keys. Of those
certificates and public/private key pairs can be used with GnuTLS. PKCS
#11's main advantage is that it allows operations on private key
objects such as decryption and signing without exposing the key. In
GnuTLS the PKCS #11 functionality is available in `gnutls/pkcs11.h'.

Moreover PKCS #11 can be (ab)used to allow all applications in the same
operating system to access shared cryptographic keys and certificates
in a uniform way, as in *note fig:pkcs11-vision::.  That way
applications could load their trusted certificate list, as well as user
certificates from a common PKCS #11 module. Such a provider exists in
the Gnome system, being the Gnome Keyring.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: PKCS11 Initialization,  Next: Accessing objects that require a PIN,  Up: Smart cards and HSMs

7.2.1 Initialization
--------------------

To allow all the  GnuTLS applications to access PKCS #11 tokens you can
use a configuration per module, stored in `/etc/pkcs11/modules/'.
These are the configuration files of p11-kit(1).  For example a file
that will load the OpenSC module, could be named
`/etc/pkcs11/modules/opensc' and contain the following:

    module: /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so

If you use this file, then there is no need for other initialization in
GnuTLS, except for the PIN and token functions (see next section).
However, you may manually initialize the PKCS #11 subsystem if the
default settings are not desirable.

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_init (unsigned int FLAGS, const char *
          DEPRECATED_CONFIG_FILE)
     FLAGS: `GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL'  or `GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO'

     DEPRECATED_CONFIG_FILE: either NULL or the location of a deprecated
     configuration file

     This function will initialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls. It
     will read configuration files if `GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO'  is
     used or allow you to independently load PKCS 11 modules using
     `gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider()' if `GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL'  is
     specified.

     Normally you don't need to call this function since it is being
     called by `gnutls_global_init()'  using the
     `GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO' . If other option is required then it
     must be called before it.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

Note that PKCS #11 modules must be reinitialized on the child processes
after a `fork'. GnuTLS provides *note gnutls_pkcs11_reinit:: to be
called for this purpose.

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_reinit ( VOID)
     This function will reinitialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls.
     This is required by PKCS 11 when an application uses `fork()' . The
     reinitialization function must be called on the child.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Accessing objects that require a PIN,  Next: Reading objects,  Prev: PKCS11 Initialization,  Up: Smart cards and HSMs

7.2.2 Accessing objects that require a PIN
------------------------------------------

Objects stored in token such as a private keys are typically protected
from access by a PIN or password. This PIN may be required to either
read the object (if allowed) or to perform operations with it. To allow
obtaining the PIN when accessing a protected object, as well as probe
the user to insert the token the following functions allow to set a
callback.

`VOID *note gnutls_pkcs11_set_token_function:: (gnutls_pkcs11_token_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'

`VOID *note gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function:: (gnutls_pin_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider:: (const char * NAME, const char * PARAMS)'

`GNUTLS_PIN_CALLBACK_T *note gnutls_pkcs11_get_pin_function:: (void ** USERDATA)'

The callback is of type `gnutls_pin_callback_t' and will have as input
the provided userdata, the PIN attempt number, a URL describing the
token, a label describing the object and flags. The PIN must be at most
of `pin_max' size and must be copied to pin variable. The function must
return 0 on success or a negative error code otherwise.

typedef int (*gnutls_pin_callback_t) (void *userdata, int attempt,
                                      const char *token_url,
                                      const char *token_label,
                                      unsigned int flags,
                                      char *pin, size_t pin_max);

The flags are of `gnutls_pin_flag_t' type and are explained below.

`GNUTLS_PIN_USER'
     The PIN for the user.

`GNUTLS_PIN_SO'
     The PIN for the security officer (admin).

`GNUTLS_PIN_FINAL_TRY'
     This is the final try before blocking.

`GNUTLS_PIN_COUNT_LOW'
     Few tries remain before token blocks.

`GNUTLS_PIN_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC'
     The PIN is for a specific action and key like signing.

`GNUTLS_PIN_WRONG'
     Last given PIN was not correct.

Figure 7.2: The `gnutls_pin_flag_t' enumeration.

Note that due to limitations of PKCS #11 there are issues when multiple
libraries are sharing a module. To avoid this problem GnuTLS uses
p11-kit that provides a middleware to control access to resources over
the multiple users.

To avoid conflicts with multiple registered callbacks for PIN functions,
*note gnutls_pkcs11_get_pin_function:: may be used to check for any
previously set functions. In addition context specific PIN functions
are allowed, e.g., by using functions below.

`VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_pin_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'

`VOID *note gnutls_pubkey_set_pin_function:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_pin_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'

`VOID *note gnutls_privkey_set_pin_function:: (gnutls_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_pin_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'

`VOID *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_set_pin_function:: (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t OBJ, gnutls_pin_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'

`VOID *note gnutls_x509_crt_set_pin_function:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, gnutls_pin_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Reading objects,  Next: Writing objects,  Prev: Accessing objects that require a PIN,  Up: Smart cards and HSMs

7.2.3 Reading objects
---------------------

All PKCS #11 objects are referenced by GnuTLS functions by URLs as
described in [_PKCS11URI_].  This allows for a consistent naming of
objects across systems and applications in the same system. For example
a public key on a smart card may be referenced as:

    pkcs11:token=Nikos;serial=307521161601031;model=PKCS%2315; \
    manufacturer=EnterSafe;object=test1;objecttype=public;\
    id=32f153f3e37990b08624141077ca5dec2d15faed

while the smart card itself can be referenced as:
    pkcs11:token=Nikos;serial=307521161601031;model=PKCS%2315;manufacturer=EnterSafe

Objects stored in a PKCS #11 token can be extracted if they are not
marked as sensitive. Usually only private keys are marked as sensitive
and cannot be extracted, while certificates and other data can be
retrieved. The functions that can be used to access objects are shown
below.

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url:: (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t OBJ, const char * URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_export_url:: (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t OBJ, gnutls_pkcs11_url_type_t DETAILED, char ** URL)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_info (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t CRT,
          gnutls_pkcs11_obj_info_t ITYPE, void * OUTPUT, size_t *
          OUTPUT_SIZE)
     CRT: should contain a `gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t'  structure

     ITYPE: Denotes the type of information requested

     OUTPUT: where output will be stored

     OUTPUT_SIZE: contains the maximum size of the output and will be
     overwritten with actual

     This function will return information about the PKCS11 certificate
     such as the label, id as well as token information where the key is
     stored. When output is text it returns null terminated string
     although  `output_size' contains the size of the actual data only.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) on success or a negative error
     code on error.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t PKCS11_CRT)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, const char * URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import_pkcs11:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERTS, unsigned int CERT_MAX, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t * const OBJS, unsigned int FLAGS)'

Properties of the physical token can also be accessed and altered with
GnuTLS.  For example data in a token can be erased (initialized), PIN
can be altered, etc.

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_init:: (const char * TOKEN_URL, const char * SO_PIN, const char * LABEL)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_url:: (unsigned int SEQ, gnutls_pkcs11_url_type_t DETAILED, char ** URL)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_info:: (const char * URL, gnutls_pkcs11_token_info_t TTYPE, void * OUTPUT, size_t * OUTPUT_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_flags:: (const char * URL, unsigned int * FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_set_pin:: (const char * TOKEN_URL, const char * OLDPIN, const char * NEWPIN, unsigned int FLAGS)'

The following examples demonstrate the usage of the API. The first
example will list all available PKCS #11 tokens in a system and the
latter will list all certificates in a token that have a corresponding
private key.

    int i;
    char* url;

    gnutls_global_init();

    for (i=0;;i++)
      {
        ret = gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_url(i, &url);
        if (ret == GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE)
          break;

        if (ret < 0)
          exit(1);

        fprintf(stdout, "Token[%d]: URL: %s\n", i, url);
        gnutls_free(url);

7.2.4 Writing objects
---------------------

With GnuTLS you can copy existing private keys and certificates to a
token. Note that when copying private keys it is recommended to mark
them as sensitive using the `GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_SENSITIVE' to
prevent its extraction. An object can be marked as private using the
flag `GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_PRIVATE', to require PIN to be
entered before accessing the object (for operations or otherwise).

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_privkey (const char *
          TOKEN_URL, gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, const char * LABEL,

7.2.5 Using a PKCS #11 token with TLS
-------------------------------------

It is possible to use a PKCS #11 token to a TLS session, as shown in
*note ex:pkcs11-client::. In addition the following functions can be
used to load PKCS #11 key and certificates by specifying a PKCS #11 URL
instead of a filename.

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'  structure.

     This function adds the system's default trusted CAs in order to

7.3 Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
=================================

In this section we present the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support in
GnuTLS. There was a big hype when the TPM chip was introduced into
computers. Briefly it is a co-processor in your PC that allows it to
perform calculations independently of the main processor. This has good
and bad side-effects. In this section we focus on the good ones, which
are the fact that you can use it to perform cryptographic operations
the similarly to a PKCS #11 smart card.  It allows for storing and
using RSA keys but with slight differences from a PKCS #11 module that
require different handling.  The basic operations supported, and used
by GnuTLS, are key generation and signing.

In GnuTLS the TPM functionality is available in `gnutls/tpm.h'.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Keys in TPM,  Next: Key generation,  Up: Trusted Platform Module

7.3.1 Keys in TPM
-----------------

The RSA keys in the TPM module may either be stored in a flash memory
within TPM or stored in a file in disk. In the former case the key can
provide operations as with PKCS #11 and is identified by a URL. The URL
is of the following form.
tpmkey:uuid=42309df8-d101-11e1-a89a-97bb33c23ad1;storage=user

It consists from a unique identifier of the key as well as the part of
the flash memory the key is stored at. The two options for the storage
field are `user' and `system'. The user keys are typically only
available to the generating user and the system keys to all users. The
stored in TPM keys are called registered keys.

The keys that are stored in the disk are exported from the TPM but in an
encrypted form. To access them two passwords are required. The first is
the TPM Storage Root Key (SRK), and the other is a key-specific
password. Also those keys are identified by a URL of the form:
tpmkey:file=/path/to/file

When objects require a PIN to be accessed the same callbacks as with
PKCS #11 objects are expected (see *note Accessing objects that require
a PIN::).


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Key generation,  Next: Using keys,  Prev: Keys in TPM,  Up: Trusted Platform Module

7.3.2 Key generation
--------------------

All keys used by the TPM must be generated by the TPM. This can be done
using *note gnutls_tpm_privkey_generate::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_generate (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t
          PK, unsigned int BITS, const char* SRK_PASSWORD, const char*
          KEY_PASSWORD, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT,
          gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t PUB_FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t* PRIVKEY,
          gnutls_datum_t* PUBKEY, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PK: the public key algorithm

     BITS: the security bits

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password to protect the exported key (optional)

     KEY_PASSWORD: the password for the TPM (optional)

     FORMAT: the format of the private key

     PUB_FORMAT: the format of the public key

     PRIVKEY: the generated key

     PUBKEY: the corresponding public key (may be null)

     FLAGS: should be a list of GNUTLS_TPM_* flags

     This function will generate a private key in the TPM chip. The
     private key will be generated within the chip and will be exported
     in a wrapped with TPM's master key form. Furthermore the wrapped
     key can be protected with the provided  `password' .

     Note that bits in TPM is quantized value. If the input value is
     not one of the allowed values, then it will be quantized to one of
     512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384.

     Allowed flags are:

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

`INT *note gnutls_tpm_get_registered:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t * LIST)'

`VOID *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_deinit:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST)'

`INT *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_get_url:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST, unsigned int IDX, char** URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete (const char* URL, const
          char* SRK_PASSWORD)
     URL: the URL describing the key

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password for the SRK key

     This function will unregister the private key from the TPM chip.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

7.3.3 Using keys
----------------

Importing keys
..............

The TPM keys can be used directly by the abstract key types and do not
require any special structures. Moreover functions like *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file:: can access TPM URLs.

`INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_tpm_raw:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * FDATA, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char * KEY_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_raw:: (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * FDATA, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_privkey_import_tpm_url (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY,
          const char* URL, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char *
          KEY_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PKEY: The private key

     URL: The URL of the TPM key to be imported

     SRK_PASSWORD: The password for the SRK key (optional)

     KEY_PASSWORD: A password for the key (optional)

     FLAGS: One of the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_* flags

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     `gnutls_privkey_t'  structure.

     Note that unless `GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS' is specified,
     if incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback
     functions will be used to obtain the correct passwords. Otherwise
     if the SRK password is wrong `GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR'  is
     returned and if the key password is wrong or not provided then
     `GNUTLS_E_TPM_KEY_PASSWORD_ERROR' is returned.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_url (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY,
          const char* URL, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, unsigned int
          FLAGS)
     PKEY: The public key

     URL: The URL of the TPM key to be imported

     SRK_PASSWORD: The password for the SRK key (optional)

     FLAGS: should be zero

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     `gnutls_privkey_t'  structure.

     Note that unless `GNUTLS_PUBKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS' is specified,
     if incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback
     functions will be used to obtain the correct passwords. Otherwise
     if the SRK password is wrong `GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR'  is
     returned.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

Listing and deleting keys
.........................

The registered keys (that are stored in the TPM) can be listed using
one of the following functions. Those keys are unfortunately only
identified by their UUID and have no label or other human friendly
identifier.  Keys can be deleted from permament storage using *note
gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete::.

`INT *note gnutls_tpm_get_registered:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t * LIST)'

`VOID *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_deinit:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST)'

`INT *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_get_url:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST, unsigned int IDX, char** URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete (const char* URL, const
          char* SRK_PASSWORD)
     URL: the URL describing the key

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password for the SRK key

     This function will unregister the private key from the TPM chip.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

    $ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:uuid=58ad734b-bde6-45c7-89d8-756a55ad1891;storage=user \
              --outfile pubkey.pem

or if the key is stored in the filesystem:
    $ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:file=tmpkey.pem --outfile pubkey.pem

To list all keys stored in TPM use:
    $ tpmtool --list

8.1 Introduction
================

This chapter tries to explain the basic functionality of the current
GnuTLS library. Note that there may be additional functionality not
discussed here but included in the library. Checking the header files
in `/usr/include/gnutls/' and the manpages is recommended.

8.1.1 General idea
------------------

A brief description of how GnuTLS sessions operate is shown at *note
fig:gnutls-design::. This section will become more clear when it is
completely read.  As shown in the figure, there is a read-only global
state that is initialized once by the global initialization function.
This global structure, among others, contains the memory allocation
functions used, structures needed for the ASN.1 parser and depending on
the system's CPU, pointers to hardware accelerated encryption
functions.  This structure is never modified by any GnuTLS function,
except for the deinitialization function which frees all allocated
memory and must be called after the program has permanently finished
using GnuTLS.

 [image src="gnutls-internals.png" ]

Figure 8.1: High level design of GnuTLS.

The credentials structures are used by the authentication methods, such
as certificate authentication. They store certificates, privates keys,
and other information that is needed to prove the identity to the peer,
and/or verify the indentity of the peer. The information stored in the
credentials structures is initialized once and then can be shared by
many TLS sessions.

A GnuTLS session contains all the required information to handle one
secure connection. The session communicates with the peers using the
provided functions of the transport layer.  Every session has a unique
session ID shared with the peer.

Since TLS sessions can be resumed, servers need a database back-end to
hold the session's parameters.  Every GnuTLS session after a successful
handshake calls the appropriate back-end function (see *note resume::)
to store the newly negotiated session. The session database is examined
by the server just after having received the client hello(1), and if
the session ID sent by the client, matches a stored session, the stored
session will be retrieved, and the new session will be a resumed one,
and will share the same session ID with the previous one.

8.1.2 Error handling
--------------------

In GnuTLS most functions return an integer type as a result.  In almost
all cases a zero or a positive number means success, and a negative
number indicates failure, or a situation that some action has to be
taken. Thus negative error codes may be fatal or not.

Fatal errors terminate the connection immediately and further sends and
receives will be disallowed.  Such an example is
`GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED'. Non-fatal errors may warn about
something, i.e., a warning alert was received, or indicate the some
action has to be taken. This is the case with the error code
`GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' returned by *note gnutls_record_recv::.  This
error code indicates that the server requests a re-handshake. The
client may ignore this request, or may reply with an alert.  You can
test if an error code is a fatal one by using the *note
gnutls_error_is_fatal::.  All errors can be converted to a descriptive
string using *note gnutls_strerror::.

If any non fatal errors, that require an action, are to be returned by
a function, these error codes will be documented in the function's
reference. For example the error codes
`GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' and `GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED'
that may returned when receiving data, should be handled by notifying
the user of the alert (as explained in *note Handling alerts::).  See
*note Error codes::, for a description of the available error codes.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Common types,  Next: Debugging and auditing,  Prev: Error handling,  Up: Introduction to the library

8.1.3 Common types
------------------

All strings that are to provided as input to GnuTLS functions should be
in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. Output strings are also in UTF-8
format unless otherwise specified.

When data of a fixed size are provided to GnuTLS functions then the
helper structure `gnutls_datum_t' is often used. Its definition is
shown below.
  typedef struct
  {
    unsigned char *data;
    unsigned int size;
  } gnutls_datum_t;

Other functions that require data for scattered read use a structure
similar to `struct iovec' typically used by `readv'. It is shown below.
  typedef struct
  {
    void *iov_base;             /* Starting address */
    size_t iov_len;             /* Number of bytes to transfer */
  } giovec_t;


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Debugging and auditing,  Next: Thread safety,  Prev: Common types,  Up: Introduction to the library

8.1.4 Debugging and auditing
----------------------------

In many cases things may not go as expected and further information, to
assist debugging, from GnuTLS is desired.  Those are the cases where
the *note gnutls_global_set_log_level:: and *note
gnutls_global_set_log_function:: are to be used. Those will print
verbose information on the GnuTLS functions internal flow.

`VOID *note gnutls_global_set_log_level:: (int LEVEL)'

`VOID *note gnutls_global_set_log_function:: (gnutls_log_func LOG_FUNC)'

When debugging is not required, important issues, such as detected
attacks on the protocol still need to be logged. This is provided by
the logging function set by *note
gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function::. The provided function will
receive an message and the corresponding TLS session. The session
information might be used to derive IP addresses or other information
about the peer involved.

 -- Function: void gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function
          (gnutls_audit_log_func LOG_FUNC)
     LOG_FUNC: it is the audit log function

     This is the function where you set the logging function gnutls is
     going to use.  This is different from
     `gnutls_global_set_log_function()' because it will report the
     session of the event if any. Note that that session might be null
     if there is no corresponding TLS session.

     `gnutls_audit_log_func' is of the form, void
     (*gnutls_audit_log_func)( gnutls_session_t, const char*);

     *Since:* 3.0


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Thread safety,  Next: Callback functions,  Prev: Debugging and auditing,  Up: Introduction to the library

8.1.5 Thread safety
-------------------

The GnuTLS library is thread safe by design, meaning that objects of
the library such as TLS sessions, can be safely divided across threads
as long as a single thread accesses a single object. This is sufficient
to support a server which handles several sessions per thread.  If,
however, an object needs to be shared across threads then access must be
protected with a mutex. Read-only access to objects, for example the
credentials holding structures, is also thread-safe.

The random generator of the cryptographic back-end, is not thread safe
and requires mutex locks which are setup by GnuTLS.  Applications can
either call *note gnutls_global_init:: which will initialize the default
operating system provided locks (i.e. `pthreads' on GNU/Linux and
`CriticalSection' on Windows), or manually specify the locking system
using the function *note gnutls_global_set_mutex:: before calling *note
gnutls_global_init::.  Setting mutexes manually is recommended only for
applications that have full control of the underlying libraries. If this
is not the case, the use of the operating system defaults is
recommended. An example of non-native thread usage is shown below.

    #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

    int main()
    {
       /* When the system mutexes are not to be used
        * gnutls_global_set_mutex() must be called explicitly
        */
       gnutls_global_set_mutex (mutex_init, mutex_deinit,
                                mutex_lock, mutex_unlock);
       gnutls_global_init();
    }

 -- Function: void gnutls_global_set_mutex (mutex_init_func INIT,
          mutex_deinit_func DEINIT, mutex_lock_func LOCK,
          mutex_unlock_func UNLOCK)
     INIT: mutex initialization function

     DEINIT: mutex deinitialization function

     LOCK: mutex locking function

     UNLOCK: mutex unlocking function

     With this function you are allowed to override the default mutex
     locks used in some parts of gnutls and dependent libraries. This
     function should be used if you have complete control of your
     program and libraries.  Do not call this function from a library.
     Instead only initialize gnutls and the default OS mutex locks will
     be used.

     This function must be called before `gnutls_global_init()' .

     *Since:* 2.12.0


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Callback functions,  Prev: Thread safety,  Up: Introduction to the library

8.1.6 Callback functions
------------------------

There are several cases where GnuTLS may need out of band input from
your program. This is now implemented using some callback functions,
which your program is expected to register.

An example of this type of functions are the push and pull callbacks
which are used to specify the functions that will retrieve and send
data to the transport layer.

`VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_push_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_pull_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_func PULL_FUNC)'

Other callback functions may require more complicated input and data to
be allocated. Such an example is *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function::.  All callbacks should
allocate and free memory using `gnutls_malloc' and `gnutls_free'.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Preparation,  Next: Session initialization,  Prev: Introduction to the library,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

8.2 Preparation
===============

To use GnuTLS, you have to perform some changes to your sources and
your build system. The necessary changes are explained in the following
subsections.

* Menu:

* Headers::
* Initialization::
* Version check::
* Building the source::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Headers,  Next: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

8.2.1 Headers
-------------

All the data types and functions of the GnuTLS library are defined in
the header file `gnutls/gnutls.h'.  This must be included in all
programs that make use of the GnuTLS library.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Initialization,  Next: Version check,  Prev: Headers,  Up: Preparation

8.2.2 Initialization
--------------------

GnuTLS must be initialized before it can be used.  The library is
initialized by calling *note gnutls_global_init::.  The resources
allocated by the initialization process can be released if the
application no longer has a need to call GnuTLS functions, this is done
by calling *note gnutls_global_deinit::.

In order to take advantage of the internationalization features in
GnuTLS, such as translated error messages, the application must set the
current locale using `setlocale' before initializing GnuTLS.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Version check,  Next: Building the source,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

8.2.3 Version check
-------------------

It is often desirable to check that the version of `gnutls' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility
new features may have been introduced but due to problem with the
dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to
check that the version is okay right after program start-up.  See the
function *note gnutls_check_version::.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Building the source,  Prev: Version check,  Up: Preparation

8.2.4 Building the source
-------------------------

If you want to compile a source file including the `gnutls/gnutls.h'
header file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the `-I' option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, the library uses the
external package `pkg-config' that knows the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The options that need to be added to
the compiler invocation at compile time are output by the `--cflags'
option to `pkg-config gnutls'.  The following example shows how it can
be used at the command line:

    gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags`

Adding the output of `pkg-config gnutls --cflags' to the compilers
command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
`gnutls/gnutls.h' header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the `-L' option).  For this, the option `--libs' to
`pkg-config gnutls' can be used.  For convenience, this option also
outputs all other options that are required to link the program with
the library (for instance, the `-ltasn1' option).  The example shows
how to link `foo.o' with the library to a program `foo'.

    gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config gnutls --libs`

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to `pkg-config':

    gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags --libs`

When a program uses the GNU autoconf system, then the following line or
similar can be used to detect the presence of GnuTLS.

    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBGNUTLS], [gnutls >= 3.0.0])

    AC_SUBST([LIBGNUTLS_CFLAGS])
    AC_SUBST([LIBGNUTLS_LIBS])

8.3 Session initialization
==========================

In the previous sections we have discussed the global initialization
required for GnuTLS as well as the initialization required for each
authentication method's credentials (see *note Authentication::).  In
this section we elaborate on the TLS or DTLS session initiation.  Each
session is initialized using *note gnutls_init:: which among others is
used to specify the type of the connection (server or client), and the
underlying protocol type, i.e., datagram (UDP) or reliable (TCP).

 -- Function: int gnutls_init (gnutls_session_t * SESSION, unsigned int
          FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a pointer to a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     FLAGS: indicate if this session is to be used for server or client.

     This function initializes the current session to null. Every
     session must be initialized before use, so internal structures can
     be allocated.  This function allocates structures which can only
     be free'd by calling `gnutls_deinit()' .  Returns
     `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) on success.

     `flags' can be one of `GNUTLS_CLIENT'  and `GNUTLS_SERVER' . For a
     DTLS entity, the flags `GNUTLS_DATAGRAM'  and  `GNUTLS_NONBLOCK'
     are also available. The latter flag will enable a non-blocking
     operation of the DTLS timers.

     Note that since version 3.1.2 this function enables some common
     TLS extensions such as session tickets and OCSP certificate status
     request in client side by default. To prevent that use the
     `GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS' flag.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  on success, or an error code.

After the session initialization details on the allowed ciphersuites
and protocol versions should be set using the priority functions such
as *note gnutls_priority_set_direct::. We elaborate on them in *note
Priority Strings::.  The credentials used for the key exchange method,
such as certificates or usernames and passwords should also be
associated with the session current session using *note
gnutls_credentials_set::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_credentials_set (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_credentials_type_t TYPE, void * CRED)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     TYPE: is the type of the credentials

     CRED: is a pointer to a structure.

     Sets the needed credentials for the specified type.  Eg username,
     password - or public and private keys etc.  The  `cred' parameter
     is a structure that depends on the specified type and on the
     current session (client or server).

     In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials between
     several threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred, and not the whole
     cred structure.  Thus you will have to keep the structure allocated
     until you call `gnutls_deinit()' .

     For `GNUTLS_CRD_ANON' ,  `cred' should be
     `gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t'  in case of a client.  In case
     of a server it should be `gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t' .

     For `GNUTLS_CRD_SRP' ,  `cred' should be
     `gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t' in case of a client, and
     `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t' , in case of a server.

     For `GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE' ,  `cred' should be
     `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' .

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error code is returned.

8.4 Associating the credentials
===============================

* Menu:

* Certificate credentials::
* SRP credentials::
* PSK credentials::
* Anonymous credentials::

Each authentication method is associated with a key exchange method,
and a credentials type.  The contents of the credentials is
method-dependent, e.g. certificates for certificate authentication and
should be initialized and associated with a session (see *note
gnutls_credentials_set::).  A mapping of the key exchange methods with
the credential types is shown in *note tab:key-exchange-cred::.

8.4.1 Certificates
------------------

Server certificate authentication
.................................

When using certificates the server is required to have at least one
certificate and private key pair. Clients may not hold such a pair, but
a server could require it. In this section we discuss general issues
applying to both client and server certificates. The next section will
elaborate on issues arising from client authentication only.

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t *                                          RES)'

`VOID *note gnutls_certificate_free_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC)'

After the credentials structures are initialized, the certificate and
key pair must be loaded. This occurs before any TLS session is
initialized, and the same structures are reused for multiple sessions.
Depending on the certificate type different loading functions are
available, as shown below.  For X.509 certificates, the functions will
accept and use a certificate chain that leads to a trusted authority.
The certificate chain must be ordered in such way that every
certificate certifies the one before it. The trusted authority's
certificate need not to be included since the peer should possess it
already.

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT_LIST, int CERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_mem:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t CRT, gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t PKEY)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

Note however, that since functions like *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file:: may accept URLs that specify
objects stored in token, another important function is *note
gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function::. That allows setting a callback
function to retrieve a PIN if the input keys are protected by PIN by
the token.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_pin_callback_t
          FN, void * USERDATA)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'  structure.

     FN: A PIN callback

     USERDATA: Data to be passed in the callback

     This function will set a callback function to be used when
     required to access a protected object. This function overrides any
     other global PIN functions.

     Note that this function must be called right after initialization
     to have effect.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

If the imported keys and certificates need to be accessed before any
TLS session is established, it is convenient to use *note
gnutls_certificate_set_key:: in combination with *note
gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: and *note
gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_key
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char** NAMES,
          int NAMES_SIZE, gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT_LIST, int
          PCERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_privkey_t KEY)
     RES: is a `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'  structure.

     NAMES: is an array of DNS name of the certificate (NULL if none)

     NAMES_SIZE: holds the size of the names list

     PCERT_LIST: contains a certificate list (path) for the specified
     private key

     PCERT_LIST_SIZE: holds the size of the certificate list

     KEY: is a `gnutls_privkey_t'  key

     This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
     gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
     called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
     the server.  For clients that wants to send more than its own end
     entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put
     the certificate chain in  `pcert_list' . The  `pcert_list' and
     `key' will become part of the credentials structure and must not
     be deallocated. They will be automatically deallocated when  `res'
     is deinitialized.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) on success, or a negative error
     code.

     *Since:* 3.0

If multiple certificates are used with the functions above each
client's request will be served with the certificate that matches the
requested name (see *note Server name indication::).

As an alternative to loading from files or buffers, a callback may be
used for the server or the client to specify the certificate and the
key at the handshake time.  In that case a certificate should be
selected according the peer's signature algorithm preferences. To get
those preferences use *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested::. Both
functions are shown below.

`INT *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t INDX, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * ALGO)'

The functions above do not handle the requested server name
automatically.  A server would need to check the name requested by the
client using *note gnutls_server_name_get::, and serve the appropriate
certificate. Note that some of these functions require the
`gnutls_pcert_st' structure to be filled in. Helper functions to make
the required structures are listed below.

typedef struct gnutls_pcert_st
{
  gnutls_pubkey_t pubkey;
  gnutls_datum_t cert;
  gnutls_certificate_type_t type;
} gnutls_pcert_st;

`INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_openpgp:: (gnutls_pcert_st* PCERT, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, const gnutls_datum_t* CERT, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_openpgp_raw:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, const gnutls_datum_t* CERT, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, gnutls_openpgp_keyid_t KEYID, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`VOID *note gnutls_pcert_deinit:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT)'

In a handshake, the negotiated cipher suite depends on the
certificate's parameters, so some key exchange methods might not be
available with all certificates. GnuTLS will disable ciphersuites that
are not compatible with the key, or the enabled authentication methods.
For example keys marked as sign-only, will not be able to access the
plain RSA ciphersuites, that require decryption. It is not recommended
to use RSA keys for both signing and encryption. If possible use a
different key for the `DHE-RSA' which uses signing and `RSA' that
requires decryption.  All the key exchange methods shown in *note Table
4.1: tab:key-exchange. are available in certificate authentication.

Client certificate authentication
.................................

If a certificate is to be requested from the client during the
handshake, the server will send a certificate request message. This
behavior is controlled *note gnutls_certificate_server_set_request::.
The request contains a list of the acceptable by the server certificate
signers. This list is constructed using the trusted certificate
authorities of the server.  In cases where the server supports a large
number of certificate authorities it makes sense not to advertise all
of the names to save bandwidth. That can be controlled using the
function *note gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence::.  This
however will have the side-effect of not restricting the client to
certificates signed by server's acceptable signers.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_server_set_request
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_certificate_request_t REQ)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     REQ: is one of GNUTLS_CERT_REQUEST, GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE

     This function specifies if we (in case of a server) are going to
     send a certificate request message to the client. If  `req' is
     GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE then the server will return an error if the
     peer does not provide a certificate. If you do not call this
     function then the client will not be asked to send a certificate.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int STATUS)
     SESSION: is a pointer to a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     STATUS: is 0 or 1

     If status is non zero, this function will order gnutls not to send
     the rdnSequence in the certificate request message. That is the
     server will not advertise its trusted CAs to the peer. If status
     is zero then the default behaviour will take effect, which is to
     advertise the server's trusted CAs.

     This function has no effect in clients, and in authentication
     methods other than certificate with X.509 certificates.

Client or server certificate verification
.........................................

Certificate verification is possible by loading the trusted authorities
into the credentials structure by using the following functions,
applicable to X.509 and OpenPGP certificates.

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t C, const char * FILE, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

The peer's certificate is not automatically verified and one must call
*note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: after a successful handshake
to verify the certificate's signature and the owner of the certificate.
The verification status returned can be printed using *note
gnutls_certificate_verification_status_print::.

Alternatively the verification can occur during the handshake by using
*note gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function::.

The functions above provide a brief verification output. If a detailed
output is required one should call *note gnutls_certificate_get_peers::
to obtain the raw certificate of the peer and verify it using the
functions discussed in *note X.509 certificates::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3 (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, const char* HOSTNAME, unsigned int * STATUS)
     SESSION: is a gnutls session

     HOSTNAME: is the expected name of the peer; may be `NULL'

     STATUS: is the output of the verification

     This function will verify the peer's certificate and store the
     status in the  `status' variable as a bitwise or'd
     gnutls_certificate_status_t values or zero if the certificate is
     trusted. Note that value in  `status' is set only when the return
     value of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a
     certificate does not imply a negative return value).

     If the  `hostname' provided is non-NULL then this function will
     compare the hostname in the certificate against the given. If they
     do not match the `GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER'  status flag will
     be set.

     If available the OCSP Certificate Status extension will be
     utilized by this function.

     To avoid denial of service attacks some default upper limits
     regarding the certificate key size and chain size are set. To
     override them use `gnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits()' .

     *Returns:* a negative error code on error and `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'
     (0) on success.

     *Since:* 3.1.4

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_certificate_verify_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function sets a callback to be called when peer's certificate
     has been received in order to verify it on receipt rather than
     doing after the handshake is completed.

     The callback's function prototype is: int
     (*callback)(gnutls_session_t);

     If the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it, in
     the handshake, just after the certificate message has been
     received.  To verify or obtain the certificate the
     `gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()' ,
     `gnutls_certificate_type_get()' , `gnutls_certificate_get_peers()'
     functions can be used.

     The callback function should return 0 for the handshake to continue
     or non-zero to terminate.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

8.4.2 SRP
---------

The initialization functions in SRP credentials differ between client
and server.  Clients supporting SRP should set the username and password
prior to connection, to the credentials structure.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function:: may be used instead, to
specify a callback function that should return the SRP username and

 -- Function: void gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function
          (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the
     username and password for client SRP authentication.  The
     callback's function form is:

     int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username, char**password);

     The  `username' and  `password' must be allocated using
     `gnutls_malloc()' .   `username' and  `password' should be ASCII
     strings or UTF-8 strings prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of
     "stringprep".

     The callback function will be called once per handshake before the
     initial hello message is sent.

     The callback should not return a negative error code the second
     time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

     The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
     error.

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and SRP verifiers from password files. These password file format is
compatible the with the _Stanford srp libraries_ format.  If a
different password file format is to be used, then *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function:: should be called, to set
an appropriate callback.

 -- Function: int gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_file
          (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t RES, const char *
          PASSWORD_FILE, const char * PASSWORD_CONF_FILE)
     RES: is a `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     PASSWORD_FILE: is the SRP password file (tpasswd)

     PASSWORD_CONF_FILE: is the SRP password conf file (tpasswd.conf)

     This function sets the password files, in a
     `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.  Those password files
     hold usernames and verifiers and will be used for SRP
     authentication.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

 -- Function: void gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function
          (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_srp_server_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's
     SRP credentials.  The callback's function form is:

     int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
     gnutls_datum_t* salt, gnutls_datum_t *verifier, gnutls_datum_t* g,
     gnutls_datum_t* n);

     `username' contains the actual username.  The  `salt' ,
     `verifier' ,  `generator' and  `prime' must be filled in using the
     `gnutls_malloc()' . For convenience  `prime' and  `generator' may
     also be one of the static parameters defined in gnutls.h.

     In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will
     assume that the username does not exist.

     In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames, if a
     user does not exist, g and n values should be filled in using a
     random user's parameters. In that case the callback must return
     the special value (1).

     The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
     callback function should return 0 on success, while -1 indicates
     an error.

The initialization functions in PSK credentials differ between client
and server.

`INT *note gnutls_psk_allocate_server_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t * SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_psk_free_server_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_psk_free_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t SC)'

Clients supporting PSK should supply the username and key before a TLS
session is established.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function:: can be used to specify a
callback function. This has the advantage that the callback will be
called only if PSK has been negotiated.

`INT *note gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t RES, const char * USERNAME, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_psk_key_flags FLAGS)'

     CRED: is a `gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the
     username and password for client PSK authentication.  The
     callback's function form is: int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t,
     char** username, gnutls_datum_t* key);

     The  `username' and  `key' ->data must be allocated using
     `gnutls_malloc()' .   `username' should be ASCII strings or UTF-8
     strings prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of "stringprep".

     The callback function will be called once per handshake.

     The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
     error.

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and PSK keys from a password file. The password file should contain
usernames and keys in hexadecimal format. The name of the password file
can be stored to the credentials structure by calling *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file::.  If a different password file
format is to be used, then a callback should be set instead by *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function::.

The server can help the client chose a suitable username and password,
by sending a hint. Note that there is no common profile for the PSK
hint and applications are discouraged to use it.  A server, may specify
the hint by calling *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint::.
The client can retrieve the hint, for example in the callback function,
using *note gnutls_psk_client_get_hint::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file
          (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t RES, const char *

     RES: is a `gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     PASSWORD_FILE: is the PSK password file (passwd.psk)

     This function sets the password file, in a
     `gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t'  structure.  This password file
     holds usernames and keys and will be used for PSK authentication.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Setting up the transport layer,  Next: TLS handshake,  Prev: Associating the credentials,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

8.5 Setting up the transport layer
==================================

The next step is to setup the underlying transport layer details. The
Berkeley sockets are implicitly used by GnuTLS, thus a call to *note
gnutls_transport_set_ptr2:: would be sufficient to specify the socket
descriptor.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_ptr2 (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_transport_ptr_t RECV_PTR, gnutls_transport_ptr_t
          SEND_PTR)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     RECV_PTR: is the value for the pull function

     SEND_PTR: is the value for the push function

     Used to set the first argument of the transport function (for push
     and pull callbacks). In berkeley style sockets this function will
     set the connection descriptor.  With this function you can use two
     different pointers for receiving and sending.

`VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_ptr:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR)'

If however another transport layer than TCP is selected, then the
following functions have to be specified.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_push_function (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     PUSH_FUNC: a callback function similar to `write()'

     This is the function where you set a push function for gnutls to
     use in order to send data.  If you are going to use berkeley style
     sockets, you do not need to use this function since the default
     send(2) will probably be ok.  Otherwise you should specify this
     function for gnutls to be able to send data.  The callback should
     return a positive number indicating the bytes sent, and -1 on
     error.

     `push_func' is of the form, ssize_t
     (*gnutls_push_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const void*, size_t);

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_vec_push_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_vec_push_func VEC_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     VEC_FUNC: a callback function similar to `writev()'

     Using this function you can override the default writev(2)
     function for gnutls to send data. Setting this callback instead of
     `gnutls_transport_set_push_function()'  is recommended since it
     introduces less overhead in the TLS handshake process.

     `vec_func' is of the form, ssize_t (*gnutls_vec_push_func)
     (gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const giovec_t * iov, int iovcnt);

     *Since:* 2.12.0

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_function (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, gnutls_pull_func PULL_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     PULL_FUNC: a callback function similar to `read()'

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to receive
     data.  Normally, if you use berkeley style sockets, do not need to
     use this function since the default recv(2) will probably be ok.
     The callback should return 0 on connection termination, a positive
     number indicating the number of bytes received, and -1 on error.

     `gnutls_pull_func' is of the form, ssize_t
     (*gnutls_pull_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, void*, size_t);

The functions above accept a callback function which should return the
number of bytes written, or -1 on error and should set `errno'
appropriately.  In some environments, setting `errno' is unreliable.
For example Windows have several errno variables in different CRTs, or
in other systems it may be a non thread-local variable.  If this is a
concern to you, call *note gnutls_transport_set_errno:: with the
intended errno value instead of setting `errno' directly.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_errno (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, int ERR)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     ERR: error value to store in session-specific errno variable.

     Store  `err' in the session-specific errno variable.  Useful values
     for  `err' is EAGAIN and EINTR, other values are treated will be
     treated as real errors in the push/pull function.

     This function is useful in replacement push and pull functions set
     by `gnutls_transport_set_push_function()'  and
     `gnutls_transport_set_pull_function()'  under Windows, where the
     replacements may not have access to the same  `errno' variable
     that is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to
     msvcr71.dll and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

GnuTLS currently only interprets the EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE errno
values and returns the corresponding GnuTLS error codes:
   * `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'

   * `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'

   * `GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET'
The EINTR and EAGAIN values are returned by interrupted system calls,
or when non blocking IO is used.  All GnuTLS functions can be resumed
(called again), if any of the above error codes is returned. The
EMSGSIZE value is returned when attempting to send a large datagram.

In the case of DTLS it is also desirable to override the generic
transport functions with functions that emulate the operation of
`recvfrom' and `sendto'. In addition DTLS requires timers during the
receive of a handshake message, set using the *note
gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function:: function. To check the
retransmission timers the function *note gnutls_dtls_get_timeout:: is
provided, which returns the time remaining until the next
retransmission, or better the time until *note gnutls_handshake::
should be called again.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_timeout_func FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     FUNC: a callback function

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know
     whether data are ready to be received. It should wait for data a
     given time frame in milliseconds. The callback should return 0 on
     timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and -1 on
     error.  You'll need to override this function if `select()'  is
     not suitable for the provided transport calls.  The callback
     function is used in DTLS only.

     `gnutls_pull_timeout_func' is of the form, ssize_t
     (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int
     ms);

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function will return the milliseconds remaining for a
     retransmission of the previously sent handshake message. This
     function is useful when DTLS is used in non-blocking mode, to
     estimate when to call `gnutls_handshake()' if no packets have been
     received.

     *Returns:* the remaining time in milliseconds.

8.5.1 Asynchronous operation
----------------------------

GnuTLS can be used with asynchronous socket or event-driven programming.
The approach is similar to using Berkeley sockets under such an
environment.  The blocking, due to network interaction, calls such as
*note gnutls_handshake::, *note gnutls_record_recv::, can be set to
non-blocking by setting the underlying sockets to non-blocking.  If
other push and pull functions are setup, then they should behave the
same way as `recv' and `send' when used in a non-blocking way, i.e.,
set errno to `EAGAIN'. Since, during a TLS protocol session GnuTLS does
not block except for network interaction, the non blocking `EAGAIN'
errno will be propagated and GnuTLS functions will return the
`GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' error code. Such calls can be resumed the same way as
a system call would.  The only exception is *note gnutls_record_send::,
which if interrupted subsequent calls need not to include the data to be
sent (can be called with NULL argument).

The `select' system call can also be used in combination with the
GnuTLS functions. `select' allows monitoring of sockets and notifies on
them being ready for reading or writing data. Note however that this
system call cannot notify on data present in GnuTLS read buffers, it is
only applicable to the kernel sockets API. Thus if you are using it for
reading from a GnuTLS session, make sure that any cached data are read
completely. That can be achieved by checking there are no data waiting
to be read (using *note gnutls_record_check_pending::), either before
the `select' system call, or after a call to *note
gnutls_record_recv::. GnuTLS does not keep a write buffer, thus when
writing no additional actions are required.

Although in the TLS protocol implementation each call to receive or send
function implies to restoring the same function that was interrupted, in
the DTLS protocol this requirement isn't true.  There are cases where a
retransmission is required, which are indicated by a received message
and thus *note gnutls_record_get_direction:: must be called to decide
which direction to check prior to restoring a function call.

 -- Function: int gnutls_record_get_direction (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function provides information about the internals of the
     record protocol and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call
     (e.g.  `gnutls_handshake()' ) was interrupted for some reason, that
     is, if a function returned `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  or
     `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' .  In such a case, you might want to call
     `select()' or `poll()'  before calling the interrupted gnutls
     function again.  To tell you whether a file descriptor should be
     selected for either reading or writing,
     `gnutls_record_get_direction()'  returns 0 if the interrupted
     function was trying to read data, and 1 if it was trying to write
     data.

     *Returns:* 0 if trying to read data, 1 if trying to write data.

Moreover, to prevent blocking from DTLS' retransmission timers to block
a handshake, the *note gnutls_init:: function should be called with the
`GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' flag set (see *note Session initialization::).

8.5.2 DTLS sessions
-------------------

Because datagram TLS can operate over connections where the peer of a
server cannot be reliably verified, functionality is available to
prevent denial of service attacks. GnuTLS requires a server to generate
a secret key that is used to sign a cookie(1).  That cookie is sent to
the client using *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_send::, and the client must
reply using the correct cookie. The server side should verify the
initial message sent by client using *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify::.
If successful the session should be initialized and associated with the
cookie using *note gnutls_dtls_prestate_set::, before proceeding to the
handshake.

`INT *note gnutls_key_generate:: (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, unsigned int KEY_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_send:: (gnutls_datum_t* KEY, void* CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st* PRESTATE, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)'

`INT *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify:: (gnutls_datum_t* KEY, void* CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, void* _MSG, size_t MSG_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st* PRESTATE)'

`VOID *note gnutls_dtls_prestate_set:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st* PRESTATE)'

Note that the above apply to server side only and they are not
mandatory to be used. Not using them, however, allows denial of service
attacks.  The client side cookie handling is part of *note
gnutls_handshake::.

Datagrams are typically restricted by a maximum transfer unit (MTU).
For that both client and server side should set the correct maximum
transfer unit for the layer underneath GnuTLS. This will allow proper
fragmentation of DTLS messages and prevent messages from being silently
discarded by the transport layer. The "correct" maximum transfer unit
can be obtained through a path MTU discovery mechanism [_RFC4821_].

`VOID *note gnutls_dtls_set_mtu:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int MTU)'

`UNSIGNED INT *note gnutls_dtls_get_mtu:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'

`UNSIGNED INT *note gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'

8.6 TLS handshake
=================

Once a session has been initialized and a network connection has been
set up, TLS and DTLS protocols perform a handshake. The handshake is
the actual key exchange.

 -- Function: int gnutls_handshake (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function does the handshake of the TLS/SSL protocol, and
     initializes the TLS connection.

     This function will fail if any problem is encountered, and will
     return a negative error code. In case of a client, if the client
     has asked to resume a session, but the server couldn't, then a
     full handshake will be performed.

     The non-fatal errors such as `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'  and
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  interrupt the handshake procedure, which
     should be resumed later.  Call this function again, until it
     returns 0; cf.  `gnutls_record_get_direction()'  and
     `gnutls_error_is_fatal()' .

     If this function is called by a server after a rehandshake request
     then `GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA'  or
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED'  may be returned.  Note that
     these are non fatal errors, only in the specific case of a
     rehandshake.  Their meaning is that the client rejected the
     rehandshake request or in the case of
     `GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA'  it might also mean that some data
     were pending.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  on success, otherwise a negative
     error code.

 -- Function: void gnutls_handshake_set_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, unsigned int MS)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     MS: is a timeout value in milliseconds

     This function sets the timeout for the handshake process to the
     provided value. Use an  `ms' value of zero to disable timeout.

     Note that in order for the timeout to be enforced
     `gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function()'  must be set.

The handshake process doesn't ensure the verification of the peer's
identity. When certificates are in use, this can be done, either after
the handshake is complete, or during the handshake if *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function:: has been used. In both cases
the *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: function can be used to
verify the peer's certificate (see *note Certificate authentication::
for more information).

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int * STATUS)'
